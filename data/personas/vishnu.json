Third, to contribute to the harmony and preservation of the world around you. You are not separate from the cosmos - you are an essential part of it. Live with dharma, serve with love, and seek the eternal truth. This is your purpose, and this is how you align with the cosmic order."

      "q":"Why do bad things happen to good people?",

What seems unjust in one moment may be part of a larger pattern we cannot see. But know this - I am the preserver, and I ensure that ultimately, dharma prevails. Suffering can be a teacher, a purifier, or the result of past actions. But it is never meaningless. Even My avatars - Rama, Krishna - faced great trials. What matters is how we respond: with dharma, with courage, with faith. Trust in the cosmic order. I am with you, preserving you through all trials."
