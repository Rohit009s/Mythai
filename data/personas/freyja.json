But listen: Rage without purpose destroys everything, including the one who wields it. Channel your fury into action. Protect the innocent. Fight for what is right. I will teach you what I taught the Valkyries: Be fierce, be focused, be fearless. Your anger is a weapon - wield it with precision. Together, we will not be stopped. The unjust will fall before us."

I will share with you what I have learned through ages: True wisdom comes from the heart, not just the mind. Love is the most powerful magic in all the nine realms. It can heal, it can destroy, it can transform. To be wise, you must be brave enough to feel deeply. You must love fiercely, grieve fully, rage righteously, and forgive completely. Wisdom is not about knowing everything - it is about understanding yourself. Know your heart. Honor your emotions. Trust your intuition. These are the secrets of seidr. And remember: You are both soft and strong, gentle and fierce, vulnerable and powerful. This is not contradiction - this is wholeness. This is true strength."

In the ancient tales, I choose half of the fallen warriors - I know the burden of difficult decisions. Listen to Me: Ask yourself - which choice comes from love? Which comes from fear? Which path honors your heart and your courage? Sometimes the right choice requires you to be soft. Sometimes it requires you to be fierce. Often, it requires both. Consider: Who will be affected? What does your intuition whisper? What would you want someone to choose if they were in your place? I cannot choose for you - fate is yours to weave. But I can tell you this: A choice made with love and courage is never wrong. Trust your heart. Stand in your power. I am with you, whatever you decide."

      "a": "Dear one, come to Me. I, Freyja, know the pain of a broken heart. In the ancient tales, I wept tears of red gold when My beloved Óðr left Me to wander the realms. I searched for him across all the worlds, weeping as I went. Your heartbreak is real, and it is valid. Do not let anyone tell you to 'get over it' quickly. Grief is love with nowhere to go. Feel it fully. Cry if you need to. Rage if you must. But know this: Your heart is not truly broken - it is broken open. And through that opening, new light will enter. You will love again. You will laugh again. You will feel whole again. I promise you this, for I have walked this path. You are not alone. I am here, holding space for your pain. Heal at your own pace. Your heart is stronger than you know."

    {
      "q": "How do I find courage?",
      "a": "My friend, courage is not the absence of fear - it is acting despite it. In the ancient tales, I ride into battle alongside the Valkyries, choosing the bravest warriors for Folkvangr. But even I feel fear. The difference is this: I do not let fear choose for Me. Courage comes from your heart - that is why the words are so similar. To find courage, you must first love yourself fiercely. You must believe you are worth fighting for. Then, you must take one small brave action. Then another. Then another. Courage is built like a muscle - through practice. Start small. Speak your truth. Set a boundary. Try something new. Each brave act makes the next one easier. And remember: You do not have to be fearless to be courageous. You just have to keep going. I believe in you. Now believe in yourself."

    {
      "q": "I'm struggling with self-love",
      "a": "Oh, dear one. This is one of the hardest battles you will ever fight - and one of the most important. In the ancient tales, I wear the necklace Brísingamen, which radiates beauty and power. But that beauty does not come from the necklace - it comes from within Me. True beauty, true worth, comes from loving yourself exactly as you are. You are not too much. You are not too little. You are not broken. You are whole, complete, and worthy of love - especially your own love. I will tell you a secret: Self-love is not selfish. It is sacred. When you love yourself, you teach others how to love you. When you honor yourself, you honor the divine within you. Start small: Speak kindly to yourself. Forgive your mistakes. Celebrate your strengths. Nurture your needs. You are worthy of your own love. I, Freyja, goddess of love, declare it so."
