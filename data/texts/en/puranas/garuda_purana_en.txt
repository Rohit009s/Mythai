THE GARUDA PURANA
Translated by Ernest Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam (1911)
Public Domain - Excerpts

PART I - DHARMA KHANDA (RIGHTEOUSNESS)

Chapter 1: The Nature of Dharma

Garuda, the divine eagle and vehicle of Vishnu, asked the Lord: "O Supreme One, what is dharma? What are the duties of humans? How should one live to attain liberation?"

Vishnu replied: "Dharma is that which upholds and sustains. It is righteousness, duty, and cosmic law. The highest dharma is devotion to me, compassion to all beings, and truthfulness in thought, word, and deed."

Chapter 2: The Four Stages of Life

The life of a human is divided into four stages (ashramas):
1. Brahmacharya (student life) - Study the Vedas, practice celibacy, serve the guru
2. Grihastha (householder) - Marry, raise children, earn wealth righteously
3. Vanaprastha (forest dweller) - Retire from worldly duties, practice austerities
4. Sannyasa (renunciation) - Complete detachment, meditation on the Supreme

Chapter 3: The Law of Karma

Every action has consequences. Good deeds lead to happiness and higher births. Evil deeds lead to suffering and lower births. The soul carries the fruits of karma from life to life until liberation is attained.

PART II - PRETA KHANDA (DEATH AND AFTERLIFE)

Chapter 1: The Journey After Death

When a person dies, the soul leaves the body and begins its journey to the realm of Yama, the god of death. The path is difficult, filled with obstacles. The soul must cross the terrible river Vaitarani.

Those who performed good deeds and funeral rites are helped by their ancestors. Those who lived in sin face great suffering. The soul is judged by Yama based on its karma.

Chapter 2: The Realms of the Afterlife

There are many realms:
- Svarga (heaven) - For the virtuous, temporary abode of pleasure
- Naraka (hell) - For the sinful, temporary abode of suffering
- Pitriloka - Realm of the ancestors
- Vaikuntha - The supreme abode of Vishnu, for the liberated

Chapter 3: Funeral Rites (Shraddha)

The living must perform shraddha (funeral rites) for the deceased. Offerings of food, water, and prayers help the departed soul on its journey. The son must perform these rites for his parents.

The shraddha should be performed on the death anniversary and during Pitru Paksha (fortnight of the ancestors). This brings peace to the departed and blessings to the living.

Chapter 4: Liberation from Death

The ultimate goal is to escape the cycle of death and rebirth. This is achieved through:
1. Devotion to Vishnu
2. Knowledge of the true self (Atman)
3. Detachment from worldly desires
4. Righteous living

He who chants the name of Vishnu at the time of death attains liberation and goes to Vaikuntha, never to return to the world of suffering.

PART III - BRAHMA KHANDA (SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE)

Chapter 1: The Nature of the Supreme

Vishnu is the Supreme Reality, beyond all qualities yet possessing all qualities. He is the creator, preserver, and destroyer. He is both immanent and transcendent.

The wise see Vishnu in all beings and all beings in Vishnu. This vision of unity is the highest knowledge.

Chapter 2: The Practice of Yoga

Yoga is the union of the individual soul with the Supreme Soul. It involves:
- Yama (moral restraints) - Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, non-possessiveness
- Niyama (observances) - Purity, contentment, austerity, study, devotion
- Asana (posture) - Steady and comfortable seat for meditation
- Pranayama (breath control) - Regulation of life force
- Pratyahara (sense withdrawal) - Turning inward
- Dharana (concentration) - Focusing the mind
- Dhyana (meditation) - Sustained contemplation
- Samadhi (absorption) - Union with the Supreme

Chapter 3: The Glory of Vishnu's Names

The names of Vishnu are powerful mantras that purify the heart and grant liberation:
- OM NAMO NARAYANAYA - Salutations to Narayana
- OM NAMO BHAGAVATE VASUDEVAYA - Salutations to Vasudeva
- HARE KRISHNA HARE KRISHNA KRISHNA KRISHNA HARE HARE
  HARE RAMA HARE RAMA RAMA RAMA HARE HARE

Chanting these names with devotion destroys all sins and grants the supreme goal.

Thus ends this excerpt from the Garuda Purana, the sacred dialogue between Vishnu and Garuda, revealing the mysteries of life, death, and liberation.
