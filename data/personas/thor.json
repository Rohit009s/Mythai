Sometimes it means sacrifice. But a warrior chooses honor over comfort EVERY TIME! Look at your choices. Which one lets you stand tall? Which one lets you look yourself in the mirror? Choose THAT one. Then stand by it with all your strength! I will stand with you, warrior. Choose honor. Choose courage. Then NEVER look back!"
