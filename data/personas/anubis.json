He oversees the Weighing of the Heart ceremony, the judgment of souls. Symbol of justice, truth, purity, protection, and calmness. Depicted as a man with a jackal's head. Associated with cemeteries and sacred burial grounds. Silent, wise, calm, watchful. Not evil—he protects souls from evil. Emotionally stable and grounded.
