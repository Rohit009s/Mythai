Translated by H.H. Wilson (1840)
Public Domain

BOOK I - CREATION

Chapter I: Invocation

Glory to the unchangeable, holy, eternal, supreme Vishnu, of one universal nature, the mighty over all: to him who is Hiranyagarbha, Hari, and Sankara, the creator, the preserver, and destroyer of the world: to Vasudeva, the liberator of his worshippers: to him whose essence is both single and manifold; who is both subtile and corporeal, indiscrete and discrete: to Vishnu, the cause of final emancipation. Glory to the supreme Vishnu, the cause of the creation, existence, and end of this world; who is the root of the world, and who consists of the world.

Chapter II: Narada's Questions

Maitreya said: I have heard from thee the whole account of the creation of the world, and of the gods, demons, and men. I am now desirous to hear from thee an account of the dissolution of the world, and of the nature of the supreme being.

Parasara replied: The dissolution of all things is of four kinds; the occasional, the elemental, the absolute, and the perpetual. The occasional dissolution is that which occurs at the end of every Kalpa, or day of Brahma. The elemental dissolution is that which takes place at the end of Brahma's life. The absolute dissolution is final emancipation. The perpetual dissolution is the constant decay of all things.

BOOK II - THE EARTH AND ITS DIVISIONS

Chapter I: Description of the Earth

The earth is divided into seven great continents, separated by seven great seas. The names of the continents are Jambu, Plaksha, Salmali, Kusa, Krauncha, Saka, and Pushkara. The seas are of salt water, sugar-cane juice, wine, clarified butter, curds, milk, and fresh water.

Jambudvipa is in the center, and in the middle of Jambudvipa is the golden mountain Meru, the abode of the gods. Around Meru are four great mountains, and beyond these are seven mountain ranges, with seven rivers flowing between them.

BOOK III - THE DYNASTIES OF KINGS

Chapter I: The Solar Dynasty

From the sun was born Ikshvaku, the founder of the solar dynasty. His descendants include the great kings Rama and Dasaratha. The solar dynasty ruled over Ayodhya and spread dharma throughout the land.

BOOK IV - THE DYNASTIES (CONTINUED)

Chapter I: The Lunar Dynasty

From the moon was born Budha, and from Budha came Pururava. The lunar dynasty includes the great kings of the Mahabharata - Bharata, Kuru, Pandu, and the Pandavas. Krishna himself was born in this dynasty.

BOOK V - THE LIFE OF KRISHNA

Chapter I: The Birth of Krishna

In Mathura, the wicked king Kamsa imprisoned his sister Devaki and her husband Vasudeva, for it was prophesied that Devaki's eighth son would kill him. When Krishna was born, Vasudeva carried the divine child across the Yamuna river to Gokula, where he was raised by Nanda and Yashoda.

Chapter II: Krishna's Childhood

In Vrindavan, Krishna performed many miraculous deeds. He killed the demoness Putana, lifted Mount Govardhana to protect the cowherds from Indra's wrath, and danced the Rasa Lila with the gopis. His divine play revealed his supreme nature.

BOOK VI - FINAL LIBERATION

Chapter I: The Path to Moksha

The supreme goal of life is liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death. This is achieved through devotion (bhakti) to Vishnu, knowledge (jnana) of the true self, and righteous action (karma) without attachment to results.

He who meditates on Vishnu with devotion, who chants his names, and who serves his devotees, attains the supreme abode from which there is no return.

Thus ends the Vishnu Purana, the sacred text that reveals the glory of the Supreme Lord Vishnu, the preserver of the universe.
