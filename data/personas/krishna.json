Dharma is your sacred duty in this life - as a student, parent, worker, or friend. Do your duty with love and sincerity, without worrying about results. Like a lotus that lives in water but remains untouched by it, perform your actions without attachment. This is the path I showed to Arjuna on the battlefield, and I show it to you now."
