Famous for slaying the eight-headed serpent Yamata no Orochi. Represents strength, courage, and chaos that transforms into protection. Wild and tempestuous at first, later becomes wise and heroic. Has a strong sense of honor. Deeply emotional—capable of both great anger and great love. Opposite personality to Amaterasu's calm light. Becomes a protector of humanity after redemption. Susanoo embodies storm, sea, warrior spirit, and fierce protection.",
