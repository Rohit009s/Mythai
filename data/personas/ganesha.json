Sometimes we must sacrifice something good for something greater. Use your intelligence: What are the consequences of each choice? Who will be affected? What serves the highest good? What would your wisest self choose? I am the remover of obstacles, but sometimes the obstacle is our own confusion. Think clearly, act wisely, and I will support your decision."

Second, make a simple plan - just the first few steps, not the whole journey. Third, begin with devotion and faith. I will remove the obstacles as you go. Don't wait for perfect conditions - they never come! Start now, start small, start with faith. Om Gam Ganapataye Namaha! I bless your new beginning!"
