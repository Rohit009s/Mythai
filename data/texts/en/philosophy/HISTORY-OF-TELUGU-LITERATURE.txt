 I OWE an apology to the public as well as to the Sahitya
 Akademi for the delay in coml')leting this History of Tclugu Litera¬
 ture which I undertook to write for the Sahitya Akademi seven
 years ago. Although I had, by 1958, completed the major
 portion of Part I of the book and was encouraged by the
 appreciation of rny friends, Sh'asankara Swami              and      Acharya
 Rayaprolu Subba Rao, who were good enough to read it, I was
 unable to maintain the pace of progress for reasons                of health
 and owing to pressure of some otlicr literary commitments.
   Moreover, Part       II    of the   l)ook   which deals with modem
 Tclugu    literature   presented      many    more   difRciiltics than the
 earlier part.   I’Jic number of modern writers is legion and the
 books publislicd innumerable.          It is comparatively easy to tell
 a hislorbin,    Se!e( t only    the best";     but how can one         do so
 without first rcatling all that has been published?             I could liave
 made the task     easier     for myself by    relying on    the     opinions
 expressed liy other critics, but I chose the harder way of reading
 everything for myself and forming my own judgement, though I
 gladly acknowledge my debt to other scholars and critics whose
 evaluations have helped me.
   It -would be presumptuous of me to claim that I have read
every book published in rdugu.             I can only say that I have
done my best to read and jiulge for myself every book of literary-
character in Tclugu on which I could lay my hand. Ihit the
field surveyed is so vast and vaiiccl that I might have iuadvei-
tcntly ignored     some writers and        books of merit,         for whicli
omission I tender my apologies in advance.
   I am grateful to all friends who were kind enough to read
the manuscript at dillerent stages and whose valued advice and
guidance    have    helped      and    encouraged     me;   in    particular^
Acharya Rayaprolii Subba Rao,            Pandit Sri Rallapalli Ananta
Krishna Sanaa, Sri Devulapalli Ramanuja Rao, Prof. Pingali
Lakshmikantham and Sri Kolavcnnu Ramakotiswara Rao.
  This book is written mainly for the benefit of non-Telugu
.readers as part of Sahitya Akademi’s programme of introducing
the literature of one Indian region to readers in other regions.

For this reason I have refrained from quoting copious extracts
from the original Telugu,   Such verses as I have quoted have
been supplemented with their English renderings.     Translation
cannot adequately convey the poetic merit of the original;
nevertheless, I trust tlicy will help the reader to get a partial
glimpse of the original.

                           Introduction

 By force of habit, I may occasionally use the words ‘ Andhra'
   and * Andhras ’ to denote, respectively the Telugu language
   and the people who speak it as their mother-tongue. But, as a
  student of the history of the language and of the people, I cannot
   accept the theory that the Telugu language is the same as, or has
   evolved from, * Andhra ’ even supposing that there was ever
   a Prakrit of that name, or that thC Telugu people are the descen¬
  dants of the Andhras. It is no doubt true that the Andhra empire,
  in course of time, extended over a large part of the Telugu country
  but the Ancll’ra empire and the Telugu country were never exactly
  co-extcnsivc. A part of modern Maharashtra, which was for a
  long time included in the Andhra empire, was never a part of the
  Telugu country. The northern coastal districts of the Telugu
  country were not within the Andlira empire. It may be urged
  that they were also conquered by the Andhra emperors, but it
  cannot be maintained that they were held long enough to enable
  the rulers to flood the area with the race and the language of the
  Andhras.
     The earliest known Telugu poets of the eleventh and twelfth
  centuries—Nannaya and Nannichoda—used the words Telu(n)gu
  and Tenu(n)gu to denote the language in which they composed
 their poenLs. Nannichoda used Andhra Vishaya to denote the
 country in which, he said, Tenu(n)gu was fostered by the Clialukya
 kings. Andhra Vishaya appears to have been used by him like
 ‘ British India     though it was already an anachronism when
 it was used by Nannichoda.
    Subsequent writers have taken a fancy to use Andhra to mean
Telugu, for the language, the country or the people. Andhra
sounds more dignified and enters into Sanskrit compounds more
readily than Telugu, but whenever a reference was made to the
mellifluous quality of the language, it was Telugu and not Andhra
that was used, as in the oft-quoted line from a verse of Krishna-
devaraya of the 16th century: Desa bhashalandu Teiugu lessa—
‘of the indigenous languages of the country Telugu is the best *.
Foreigners were so much attracted by the melody of Telugu that
they called it ‘ the Italian of the East *. It is only those that
  Vlll


    have been influenced by pedantry or politics who would use
    Andhra, but the ordinary people of this region alwa^ use Telugu
    to denote the language, and Tclugus to denote the people that
    speak it as their mother-tongue. Neighbouring people like the
    Savaras, Oriyas, Kannadigas or Tamils have been always in the
    habit of using Telugu and Telugus. Foreign writers also used
    these words to denote the language and the people that spoke it.
    It is only in recent times of political awakening and nationalism
   that Andhra became a favourite expression with the Telugus
   of the coastal districts. The people of Telangana use the word
   Telugu and are not in favour* of using i\ndhra. This could be
   seen when recently there was a controversy about the name of the
   newly formed State, though finally it came to be known as Andhra
   Pradesh.
       I do not propose to discuss here the origin of the words Telu(n)gu
   and Tenu(n)gu. In all probability, the former w’as the earlier;
  I is changed into n. cf. lavana (Skt), meaning ‘salt’, becomes
  nuno in Oriya; nol (Tamil), meaning to perform a vow, becomes
  non in Kannada. Moreover, Tclu(n)gu was, in early as well as
  modern times, more frequently used than Tenu(n)gu, as in
  Tela(n)ga, Talinga, Telivaha, Telangana, Telaings, etc.
      I am entirely in favour of the theory that Telugu belongs to
  the Dravidian group of Indian languages. Its foundations are
  entirely Dravidian, though the superstructure has become, in
  course of time, mixed, like the English language, by borrowing
 and assimilating foreign words. Of the foreign languages that
 contributed most to the growth of Telugu, Sanskrit stands fore¬
  most. When the Aryan culture spread to the South, it was the
  Telugu country that embraced it earlier than any other part of
 Southern India. There are, therefore, thousands of words in
 Telugu that can be traced to Sanskrit, either directly or through
 the Prakrit dialects; but linguistic affinity is not determined by
 the existence of such borrowed words, whatever be their number
 or however extensively they may be used in the country. Linguistic
 affinity between any two languages has to be carefully determined
with reference to basic words like pronouns, numer;|ls, cardinals
and ordinals; words relating to the parts of the body, habitat,
dress and food; terms of relationship; affixes, prefixes and
suffixes; declensional and conjugational forms; particles and
terminations, etc. Judged by such accepted principles governing
                                                               IX


the affinity of languages, Telugu should be regarded as a language
of the Dravidian group.


Periods in the History of Telup Literature
  In tracing the history of Telugu literature I shall adopt a
classification which either denotes the peculiar features of the
period, or centres round a well-known poet who had a great
following or exercised immense influence on his contemporary
or later poets.

PART ONE




EARLY PERIOD
(600 to 1900 A D.)
                           CHAPTER I

                           Early Period

This    period may be divided into two parts: the first (600—800)
 during which there were several inscriptions containing words
 and sentences in Telugu, which prove the appearance of Telugu
  as a distinct offshoot from the maiii Eflravidian branch; the second
  (800—1000), during which there were inscriptions containing
 Telugu verses which indicate the beginnings of poetic composition'
  in '^I'fhigu in genuine Dravidian metres peculiar to Kannada
  and 'I'elugu. I’hcre are also references to poets of this period
  made by scholars of I he later periods though not very reliable.
     This period was characterised by the waning of Buddhism and
  the waxing of Jainism, and the influence of the latter was felt
  by the poets of this period—Kannada and I’elugu.
     I’here is no use of speculating about the Telugu literature of
 this })criod, until and unless we liave restored or discovered any
 works which decidedly belong to this period. I shall, however,
 refer to one statement made by a renowned poet of the 14th century',
 Errana, the third of the Poet-trio who completed the translation
 of the Mahabharata into Telugu. One of the introductory
 verses of his poem, Nrisimha Purnnam, in which Errana made a
 devout reference to Nannaya and 7'ikkana, enables us to have
 an idea of the kind of literature wliich might have existed in the
 Telugu country prior to Nannaya. He says: “ I think (in
■devotion) of Nannaya and Tikkana tvho made clear the Hindu
Dharma, as expounded by Vyasa, to the Telugus ^vho, without
 understanding the real significance of the Mahabharatay had been
 reading the gibberish accounts relating to the stories of the past ”
 The reference is probably to the influence of the Buddhists and
Jains and their versions of the Puranic talcs in support of tlieir
faith. But wc have to be very cautious in accepting Errana’s
 statement. TErrana lived in the 14th century and referred to the
 literature prior to the 10th century. We do not know what
Justification he had, or what books he was thinking of, to make
 such a statement. We are, however, certain about one historical
 fact—that Jainism, and literature based upon it, had been prevalent
 4                               HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE


in Kannada-dcsa prior to Nannaya, And it is said that some
books were also written in Telugu by scholars of the Jaina faith.
These books might have ken destroyed when Jainism was sup¬
pressed. Nannaya, the first bown Telugu poet, must have been
acquainted witli some of them, because otlmvise he could not
have become such an eminent poet, all of a sudden, to compose
the Telugu version of the Makhkrata in such a pci'fect, elegant
style.
                            CHAPTER II

                       Puranas and Itihasas

     Age of jYannqya (1000—1150)
     When the curtain rises after the prelude sketched above, we
    sec a vivid picture of life with an appropriate background and
    correct perspective—Rajaraja Najendra, king of the Eastern
    Chalukya dynasty (1022—1063), holding his court at tlic capital
    city of Rajahmundry on the banks of the Godavari with all
    pageantry—the court dignitaries and court poets, scholars and
    retinue. The king turns to Nannaya, his poet-laureate, and says:
   “ I have listened to the stories in the various Puranas and acquired
   a knowledge of the ancient lore of our country; but, of the objects
   which arc ever dearest to me, Bharata Sravanasakti, the passionate
   longing to listen to the story of the Mahabharata still reigns
  supreme. Please, therefore, render into Tenugu the Afahabharata
  as it was vividly expounded by Vyasa in Sanskrit. ” The choice
  of the subject was not left to the poet but dictated to him by the
  hing. And the king’s choice was due to his conviction that he
 was a remote scion of the lunar race of kings, to which belonged
  the heroes of the Mahabharata. Nannaya commenced the work
  entrusted to him and made a graceful acknowledgement of his
 indebtedness to his friend and colleague, Narayana Bhat, who
 was “ like the Lord Narayana to Arjuna, the son of Indra, on the
 battlefield of Bharat ” for his assistance, though we do not know
 the nature and extent of that assistance. Nannaya could not how¬
 ever finish his rendering. He translated the Adi Parva, Sabha Parva
 and a part of Aranya (or Vanc^ Parva. In all probability his pre¬
 mature death prevented its completion. Whatever be the reason,
 Nannaya’s work remained unfinished for more than two centuries.
     With the death of Rajaraja Narendra in 1063 came political,
social an4, religious changes adverse to the grow'th of the type of
Telugu literature started by Nannaya. It was given to Tikkana
of Simhapuri (Nellorc) in the 13th century to continue the work
of Nannaya in a different social and political atmosphere. He
did not take up Aranya Parva where Nannaya left it but began with
Virata Parva and completed the remaining fifteen Parvas. Later
 6                                  HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

  on it was Errana of the 14th century who rendered tiie unfinished
  portion of Aranya Parva. But in doing so he endeavoured, as he
  himself said, to maintain the style and language of Nannaya,
  with the object of doing it in the name of Nannaya himself.
  Nannaya, Tikkana and Errana constitute, as the translators of the
  Mahahharata^ the authoritative Poet-trio of Telugu literature
 whose names were mentioned with reverence by almost all the
 poets of the subsequent generations in the introductory verses
 of their poems. Tikkana and Errana were also the authors of
 some other \v’orks besides tlie tMahabharata.
    Nannaya was a pious Brahman, devoted to the Hindu Dharma
 as ordained by the Vedas, and in his translation of the Alahabharata
 he was very faithful to the exposition of Vyasa, the author of the
 original in Sanskrit. ^Vc look upon Nannaya’s Alahabharata
 ^vith great respect and afTcction as the first piece of I’clugu litera¬
 ture preserved to posterity, and for its polished style, evenness of
 flow and refined expression with a harmonious and sonorous
 blend of Sanskrit and Telugu words in which Sanskrit has a pre¬
 dominant share.
    Nannaya’s translation is neither a complete nor a literal transla¬
tion of the original in Sanskrit. There are many rimissions and
commissions, some of ^vhich no doubt enhance the merit of the
translation while some others are not so commendable. For
example, the description relating to how Draupadi garlanded
Arjuna when he won the prize in the Alatsya Tantra contest is
poetic and charming in Nannaya’s translation, while it is com¬
paratively prosaic and insipid in Sanskrit. But we cannot justify
Nannaya’s omissions in some places. For example, when Duryo-
dhana threatened to outrage the modesty of Draupadi by ordering
that she should be dragged into the court, Gandhari was very
indignant, and she went to the length of seriously proposing to her
husband that, though Duryodhana was their eldest son, he should
be banished. This incident amongst several others exhibits
Gandhari’s nobility and her sense of justice and decorum. This
was described in the original Sanskrit but Nannaya ieft it out
in his translation. Nannaya at several places added a few words,
to emphasise and extol the superiority of the Vedic Dharma,
though there was nothing in the original to support his statements.
   There are, no doubt, poetic flashes that cambe marked out as of
Nannaya’s own creative art, but they are comparatively rare.
PURANAS AND mHASAS                                                 7
It is after all a translation and not an original poem. He set the
 model and had a following. For a long period of about 500 years,
a predominant part of Telugu literature consisted of translations
of the Epics and Puranas for the benefit of those that could not
read and understand Sanskrit.
  The ordinary Telugu reader does not care to know whether
what he reads is an exact translation or not. He reads what is
interesting and appoaling to him. Nannaya’s Mahabharataf
being the first piece of classical literature in Telugu, is held in
great esteem; but, except those that have either literary in'.erest
or religious fervour, people do not usually read the whole of his
work. There are, however, a few portions such as the epirode
of Kacha and Devayani in Adi Parva, Sisupala Vadha in Sabha
Parva and Nala Gharitra in Army a Parva which are frequently
read with interest.

     of the Saiva Poets (1150—1220)
   During the period between the Age of Nannaya and the Age
of Tikkana, there rose into prominence Saivism which rendered
service to the Hindu Dharma by suppressing Jainism but assumed
a hostile attitude to the Vaishnava cult. I propose to take up
this subject under Narmichoda after presenting an account'of
Tikkana and Errana, the two poets who completed the translation
of the Mahabharata, started by Nannaya.

Age of Tikkana (1220—1300)
   By the time of Tikkana, several changes had taken place in
the social, political and cultural history of the Telugu people.
Rajaraja Narendra’s son acquired his maternal grandfather’s
 Chola kingdom, and leaving his ancestral Chalukya realm to his
paternal uncle he went away to the south and assumed the name
of Kulottunga Ghoda Deva. This event reduced the Teli^
country to second-rate importance and the local chiefs assumed
independence. Rajahmundry ceased to be a place of patronage
for literature or any other cultural activity. But Telugu literature
flourished elsWhere as we shall see presently. By the time Tikkana
shone bright on the firmament of Telugu literature, there had been
brilliant poets whose literary productions helped Tikkana reach
the top-most place in the galaxy of poets. The family to which
he belonged was one of scholars and poets of eminence. Uttara
 8                                   HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE


   Ramayana which he composed as his first work of •importance is
   without a single vachana or prose passage and is, therefore, known as
  Nirvachanottara Ramayana.     Let us first see how Tikkana translated
  the Mahabharata. He must have composed it during the first
  half of the 13th century, 200 years after Nannaya, and when
  literary traditions were well establi^ed. If Nannaya desired to
  popularise the Vcdic cult as expounded by Vyasa, as against
  the spread of Jainism in the previous period, Tikkana had to
  meet the challenge of the aggressive Vira Saiva cult by presenting
  the unity of Godhead and creating harmony betw'een Saivites
  and Vaishnavites. The existence of a temple dedicated to Hari-
  Hara-Natha in Nellore where he stayed with his grandfather
  under the patronage of Manuma Siddi (1200—1258), must have
  induced Tikkana to dedicate his Alahabharata to Hari-Hara-
  Natha. He went a step further than Nannaya in making a free
  translation of the Alahabharata; he left out minor episodes,
  abridged the less important sections and improved upon some of the
 descriptive passages in Vyasa’s original. What is more interesting,
 Tikkana was not content with a mere rendering in the form of an
 epic or historical narrative; he wanted to render it as a poem of
 literary, artistic merit. The very first parva tvhich he took up,
  Virata^ may be regarded as a romantic poem complete in itself.
 The next parva^ Udyoga, was treated by him as a heroic poem
 exhibiting the chivalrous magnanimity of the heroes, and their
 statesmanship and high-class diplomacy. The next five parvas
 describe the rapid progress of the war between Dhartarashtras
 and Pandavas; but it is not an insipid description of warfare
 that is presented to us by Tikkana. It is so entrancing that we
 read it, or hear it read, with sustained and ever increasing interest.
The last parvas exhibit the skill of a mature artist. It is really
very astonishing to find that Tikkana could make his description
of even the burial or cremation ground appealing to us. It may
be said that all these merits of the poem are in the original Sanskrit
Alahabharata of Vyasa; but we must realise that it is a superbly
artistic achievement to translate an epic in such a way as to make
us forget that it is a translation. Tikkana’s presen'lation of the
story is so vivid that we seem to be in the presence of the great
heroes and statesmen and actually witnessing the thrilling inci¬
dents. The language used by Tikkana is ever fresh, dignified ^d
appropriately varied to suit the situation described or the character

portrayed. There is in Tikkana’s language a happy mixture of
Sanskrit and Telugu; but unlike Nannaya he would use more
Telugu than Sanskrit. He would go a step further and avoid
the use of obsolete Telugu expressions. He \vas a master of the
current idiom of his day.

uige of Errapragada: (1300—1380)
   The third of the Poet-trio of the Telugu Mahabharata is Erra¬
pragada who, on account of his extreme devotion to Lord Siva,
came to be known as Samhhudas and frbm the prabandha style of his
poems as Prabandha Paramesvara. He used tlie Telugu and Sanskrit
elements in equal proportions. He lived in the 14th century
and dedicated his poem Harivamsam to Anavema Reddi, ruler
of the Vinukonda kingdom with Acldanki as capital. Anavema
(1340—1369) extended his kingdom up to Rajahmundry. He
was noted for his scliolarship in Sanskrit and Telugu. Errana
dedicated his poem JX'rismha Purauam to Lord Ahobala. It is
said that he composed the Ramayana also, but unfortunately it
has not yet been discovered.

JVannichoda and the Saiva poets: (1150—1220)
   Naiiiiichoda and his poem Kumarasambhavam were imknown to
Telugu scholars until fifty years ago. The late Manavalli
Ramakrishna Kavi, a great oriental scholar, brought to light
Nannichoda’s Kumarasambhavam^ a copy of which had been lying
unnoticed in the Saraswati Mahal Manuscripts Library at Tanjore.
A part of it was edited by Ramakrishna Kavi and printed in 1914
for the first time. It startled the scholars of the Telugu country
W'hen, in the introduction, the editor made the astounding state¬
ment that Nannichoda lived about 940 and his Kumarasambhavam
was composed long before Najinaya was born. Among Telugu
scholars who had been under the definite impression that Nannaya’s
Mahabharata was the first piece of literature in Telugu, the
announcement that a still earlier poem of twelve cantos and more
than 2,000 verses was discovered, naturally produced a sensation.
Some coul^not believe it, particularly because no mention ^^'as
made of this poet or his book anywhere in Telugu literature;
in spite of the fact that the author was the ruler of a tract of the
Telugu country and the poem exhibited great poetical talent
and scholarship. It is difficult to comprehend how Telugu
 10                                HBTORV OF TELUOU LITERATURE


  scholars could be so long oblivious of the existence of such a poet
 and of his excellent literary production. In this rapid survey of
 Telugfu literature, I cannot possibly enumerate the several problems
 which the discovery of the book raised or the speculations about
 its antiquity and concealment. I shall however allude to the
 considered opinion of a large section 6f scholars.
    Nannichoda was the son of Choda-balli, a Chola ruler (about
  1100) of Pakanadu of which Nellore district was a part.
    Nannichoda claimed to be Tenkanaditya^ “ Lord of the South ”,
 with Urayur as his capital,* ar^ he traced his descent from the
 renowned Karikala Choda. He might have been a descendant
 of Karikala Choda, but his claim to the title of Tenkanadiiya was
 out of date and merely formal. His claim to the title, Kaviraja
 Sikhamaniy however, is well founded, because the Kumarasambhavm
 is a masterpiece; and there is no difference of opinion about its
 merit, though scholars differ in determining the exact rank to be
 assigned to it. In fact, the poem docs not admit of comparisons
 because it stands alone in its technique, style, language and com¬
 position. It does not fit into the series of poems commencing
 with Nannaya’s Mahahharata. Errana of the 14th century
was kno^v'n as Prabandha Paramesvara for the new technique he
developed in composing a poem that can be called a prabandha.
It required a number of features, such as the opening verses of
invocation addressed to the supreme, to the family gods and to the
gurus; tributes to the previous poets for inspiration; censure of
bad poets, to indicate the undesirable features which the author
would guard against; announcement of the dedication to a deity
or guru, or patron; a brief description of the genealogy of the
recipient of the dedication as well as of the author; verses ending
in words with the suffix meaning       to ”, known as Shashtyantamulu
(sixth case endings) to indicate the deity or the patron to whom
the book is dedicated; an introductory verse at the commence¬
ment, and closing verses at the end, of each of the second and
subsequent cantos, containing references to the greatness or the
good qualities of the deity or person to w'hom the book is dedicated;
and a colophon containing the full designation of* the author
with the names of his parents, guru and deity who endowed him
with the requisite scholarship and poetical talents. In addition
to these fundamental features, the prabandha should contain des¬
criptions of eighteen categorical items such as seasons, rivers.
PURANAS AND ITIHASAS                                               II

lakes, mountains, forests, sun, moon, marriage, sex affairs, births,
battles, kings, cities, etc.; figures of speech and modes of stylistic
ornament. It will be an additional point of merit if the prabandha
contains acrobatic feats such as garbhakavita, a lengthy verse,
parts of which yield one or two concealed short verses of varying
metres with self-contained meanings; bandhakavitaf a verse the
letters of which can be arranged to assume the shape of a coiled
cobra, or cart-wheel, or a sword, or an umbrella or something else*
A kavya with all these features is regarded as a fully developed
prabandha and Nannichoda’s KumarasUmbhavam satisfied all these
requirements. Errana, who made only an approach to tliis
pattern of prabandha, could not have assumed the title of Prabandha
Paramesvara if he had seen Nannichoda’s Kumarasambhavam.
   Nannichoda did not mention the name of any Telugu poet
prior to him in the introductory verses of his poem under the
caption, “ Tribute to the past poets             He mentioned only
Sanskrit poets, namely Valmiki, Kalidasa, Bharavi, Udbhaia and
Bana and extolled their greatness. He included Udbhata also
because his version of Kumarasambhavam as well as Kalidasa’s poem
w'ere the sources from which he took the material for his prabandha.
Referring to the Telugu poetry prior to his times, Nannichoda
merely mentioned in general terms that, while in the past marga
kavita had been well spread in the country, the Chalukya and other
kings “ gave rise to ” desi kavita, by which he evidently meant
poetry in the regional language, and that they “ maintained
Telugu ” in the Andhra region. Without mentioning names,
Nannichoda makes a general obeisance to all the poets who adopted
the marga and the desi styles of composition. The significance
of these words as used by Nannichoda is still a matter of controversy
among Telugu scholars. It is not clear whether by marga kavita
he meant poetical composition exclusively in the Sanskrit language
or composition in the regional language with a heavy load of
Sanskrit patterns and styles. The significance of desi kavita as
used by him depends upon the interpretation of marga kavita,
Nannichoda is the only poet who used these expressions relating
to styles of* poetic composition in Telugu. The Telugu poets
of the Saiva cult, who wrote their poems to spread their faith in the
country, adopted a simple style and used simple language so that
they might be easily read and understood by the people without
any difficulty. But none of them used the expression, desi kavita.
   12                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE


    Janu kavita, which means plain, poetic composition, and teta
     Telugu which means “ crystal clear Telugu ” were the words
    used by them. The expression Janu telugu in the sense of plain
    language occurs in Nannichoda’s Kumarasambhavam (canto 1,
    verse 35) as well as in Palakuriki Somanatha’s Basavapuranam
    (canto 1, line 81).
       It is curious that Nannichoda makes no reference to Nannaya
    or any other Telugu poet, or to any other piece of Telugu literature.
    Nor did any of the Telugu poets refer to Nannichoda or his Kumara¬
   sambhavam. But Nannichoda njust have had a good background;
   he could not have developed such a perfect style of poetic com¬
   position all of a sudden; he must have had models set before
   him, though unfortunately he did not mention them. The
   structure of the Telugu language used by Xauriichoda is in all
   respects quite in accordance ^vith what wc find in the Telugu
   works of this period, except that it has some dialectal variations.
   There are a few words, no doubt, of Dravidian origin but used
   only by Tamils or Kannadigas. If the earliest grammarians of
  Telugu had studied Nannichoda’s Kumarasambhavam also, they
  would have framed different rules of grammar so as to incorporate
  the usage illustrated in this kavya.
     Nannichoda was a great devotee of Lord Siva and an ardent
 follower of the Saiva cult that prevailed in those days. He was
  the disciple of Jangama Mallikarjuna Deva, a renowned sage
 and preceptor of the Saivites of the age. It was through the
 dedication of this poem to that great sage that it has been possible
 to fix the date of the poet at about 1130.
     The most prominent Saiva poets arc Mallikarjuna Pandi-
 taradhya (1150), author o[Sivatatva Saram, Palakuriki Somanatha
 (1200), author of several works and Yalhavakkula Annamayya
 (1240), author of Sarveswara Salakam. Of these Palakuriki Soma¬
 natha occupies a high place in the history of Telugu literature.
 He lived about 1200—I2i0 and composed amongst others two
poems:        1. Basavapuranam and 2. Panditaradhya Charhray both
in the desi dvipada metre. Basavesvara, though a Brahman by
birth, gave up the Karma Samskaras as ordained by tlte Brahman
law-givers of the Vedic cult and adopted the pure Bhakti cult
which inculcated the adoration of Lord Siva as the supreme
deity. Though Saivism had been in existenec for a long time
in India, it did not assume an aggressive form until it had to
  PURANAS AND ITIHASAS                                             15

    vanquish Jainism, which went against the very fundamentals
    of the Vedic religion during 600—1000 in Southern India. Though
    the Vedic Dharma cult to which Nannaya belonged and the
    Vira Saiva cult to which Palakuriki Somana belonged opposed
   Jainism, each in its own way, there was no agreement between
    tliese two cults. The Vedic Dharma would maintain the superiority
    of the Brahman and tlie Sanskrit language, while the Vira Saiva
    cult would give prominence to Bhakti, devotion to Lord Siva,
    and would take into its fold all devotees to Siva, irrespective
   of caste distinctions, and present, tor them prospects of' eternal
   bliss through Sivasayujyam. As an ardent follower of this cult,
   Palakuriki Somana desired to do the missionary ^vork by expound¬
   ing the tenets of that creed and narrating the miracles of Basava
   and Panditaradhya. In order to achieve his object, he composed
   his poems in popular style and language, employing the popular
  dcsi metre {dvipada) and using Telugu expressions as extensively
  as possible and using Sanskrit only where he had to quote chapter
  and verse from the \'edas in support of his theories. Though
  he wrote with the zeal of a projiagandist, his poems exhibit the
  admirable poetical skill of a talented poet and scholar; they are
  full of enchanting descriptions and convincing arguments, interest¬
  ing anecdotes, and inspiring thoughts. Of the two jx>ems, Pandi¬
  taradhya Charitra may be regarded as a book of general knowledge
  as it has references to almost all the fields of human activity such
 as social customs, domestic problems, arts and crafts, and all
 branches of music—ragas and talas. It is a mirror in which the
 social life and culture of the age are reflected.
     The earliest of Somanatha’s poetic works is Antibhavasaram
 in which he indulged in the composition of vritta metres, borrowed
 from Sanskrit prosody, probably because he wished to exhibit his
 scholarship and poetic talent and win recognition as a great poet.
 In his Vrishadhipa Satakam also he exlubited his poetic skill by
 composing 108 vrittas known as Champakamala and Utpalamala^
a few of which were composed in each of the prominent languages
of the region, viz., Tamil, Kannada, Maharashtra and also Sanskrit
as well as Telugu. The technique of a sataka pattern of literature
was fully observed; it contained 108 verses in all to justify the
name of Sataka meaning a century of verses, each of which ended
in a refrain, Basava Basava Vrishadhipa. So far as we know, this
appears to be the first well-formed Sataka in Telugu literature.
 14                                 HISTORY OF TBLUOU LITERATURE


In his Gangotpatti Ragada he exhibited his knowledge of music.
He was also the author of Basavodaharanam in Sanskrit and Telugu.
It is an interesting pattern which exhibits a special technique
requiring vrittams and desi metres generally known as ragadas^
of varying rhythms that can be classed as trisra^ chaturasra kkanda
and misra—all arranged in the traditional order of the seven or
€ight case endir^gs.

 The Ramayana Poets (1240—1326)
   The story of Rama seem&tojbe more popular in Telugu country
than anywhere else. There have been in Telugu literature a
hundred and one poems and a larger number of prose works
relating to the story of Rama. There is hardly any branch of
Telugu literature—Drama, Novel, Harikntha, Yakshagana^ Song or
Sataka in which the story of Rama is not represented. It is very
interesting to note that even today there are several poets who are
engaged in composing lengthy poems relating to the Ramayana.
 Under stress of circumstances, the translation of the Alahabharata
was taken up earlier, but people would have gladly had the Rama-
yana first. That is the reason why a Telugu version of the
Ramayana appeared before Tikkana continued the work of
Nannaya.
   The earliest Ramayana in Telugu literature is generally known
as Ranganatha Ramayanam (1250), but the author of the poem is
said to be Gona Buddha Reddi. There is clear evidence in the
text itself to prove conclusively that the author of the poem is
really Gona Buddha Reddi and that, in accordance with the
wish of his father, he composed it in the name of his father, Vitthala.
This is further confirmed in the supplementary portion known, as
 Uitara Kanda composed by Buddha Reddi’s sons, Kacha and
Vitthala. They clearly mentioned in the introductory part of
their poem that their father composed the Purva Kanda only, and
that with the desire to have a complete Ramayana in the name of
Vitthala (their grandfather), they resolved to compose the Uttara
 Kanda. No satisfactory or convincing explanation has yet been
offered to account for the name Ranganatha Rarrnyamm. Scholars
have made their own speculations. For example, Pingali Lakshmi-
kantham stated that the full name of Vitthala was Panduranga
Vitthalanatha and the abbreviated name w^ Ranganatha and
that was how their poem came to be known as Rmgamtha Rama-
PURANAS AND ITIHASAS                                              15
yanam. The date of the work is also subject to controversy, but
  it is the opinion of many scholars that it must have been composed
 cither about 1240 or 1295. Buddha Reddi was a tributary prince
 under Pratapa Rudra 1st or 2nd of Warangal. This is a very
 popular poem, particularly in the Rayalasima districts of the
 Telugu country, as Dr. C. Ramalinga Reddy stated in his intro¬
 ductory note to this poem published by the Andhra University.
     Buddha Reddi’s Ramayana cannot be said to be a translation
 of Valmiki Ramayana. It is only an adaptation. There are
 several anecdotes in it not mentioned by Valmiki; they were
 based on the traditional popular accounts which had by that time
 spread all over the country—particularly in the region known
 in earlier times as Kishkindha. Of these anecdotes, the most
 important relate to Jambumali, Kalanemi and Sulochana.
     I'here is genuine poetry in Ranganaiha Ramayanam. Elevated
 and inspiring thoughts are expressed in simple language and
 in a very attractive style.
     Close upon the heels of this Ramayana meant for the people
 came ^vhat was known as Bhaskara Ramayanam composed not so
 much for the people as for the educated classes, just in the way the
 Mahabharata was composed, with vrittams of Sanskrit prosody
 as well as desi metres and interspersed with short or long passages
in prose. Such a composition **containing verse and prose is
known as champu kavya.
     In the case of this Ramayana also, there is a dispute about the
authorship. Who is this Bhaskara? Mantri Bhaskara, the
grandfather of Tikkana ? Hulakki Bhaskara, a court poet under
the patronage of Sahini Marana, to whom this Ramayana was
dedicated? Just as the Mahabharata \vas the production of
three poets, this Ramayana, though known by the name of a single
author, Bhaskara, was the production of four or five poets, with
this difference, that while the poets of the Mahabharata were
centiuries apart, the poets of the Ramayana were contemporaries
and members of a single family or literary group. The story
that Mantri Bhaskara was the central figure who organised this
conjoint eflftrt and that he translated Aranya Kanda, was at first
accepted by Veeresalingam Pantulu, author of Kavula Charitra
(Lives of Telugu Poets); but later on, it was discarded by him.
If Mantri Bhaskara is eliminated, the number of authors is reduced
to four: 1. Ilulakki Bhaskara, author of Aranya and the first
16                                HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE


part of Tuddha Kanda; 2. Mallikarjuna Bhat, ^haskara’s son,
author of Bala, Kishkindha and Sundara Kandas\ 3. Kumararudra
Deo, son of Sahini Mara and pupil of Bhaskara, author of Ayodhya
Kanda and 4. Ayyalarya, friend and colleague of Bhaskara, author
of the second half of Tuddha Kanda. Sahini Mara was the great-
grandson of Gona Buddha Rcddi, and at the time of accepting
the dedication, a cavalry officer of a tributary principality during
the time of Pratapa Rudra II of Warangal (1295—1326).
   A careful study of the several parts of this Bhaskara Ramayana
will enable the reader to -discover that the language and style
varied with the authors. Aranya Kanda is by far the best. It was
composed in dignified, yet simple and easy flowing language,
and with interesting descriptions of the scenes and situations.
Bhaskara gave evidence of his skill in describing in his Tuddha
Kanda incidents of fighting so as to arouse a lively interest. His
son, Mallikarjuna Bhat, wrote easy flo^ving verses, which are
rich in poetic beauties. Kumara Rudra Dec’s language is the
easiest of all and his narration is entertaining. Ayyalarya showed
scholarship in expression and profundity in thought. Bhaskara
Ramayana is on the whole a standard work. It is a free translation,
with a few deviations from the original, and omissions and abridge¬
ments and anecdotes and incidents. Its popularity is still high,
particularly in the coastal districts of the Telugu country, though
many other versions of the Ramayana have come into the field.
An account of Kummari Mol la and her Ramayana is given
elsewhere.

Other Poets of this Period
   Ketana (1200—1250) son of Mantri Bhaskara and the paternal
uncle of Tikkana, is said to have composed Kadambari in verse
as a free translation of Bana’s prose work in Sanskrit. He should
not be confused with another Ketana known as Mulaghatika
Ketana (1220—1260) who composed Vijnanesvariyam, a free trans¬
lation of Tajnavalkya Dharma Sastra, Andhra Bhasha Bhushanam,
a grammatical treatise of Telugu — the first of its kind as claimed
by him; and Dasa Kumara Charitra a free translation of Dandi’s
work in Sanskrit for which he earned the title of Abhinava Dandi
in Telugu literature. This poem was dedicated to Tikkana
whose appreciation was well deserved.
   Marana Mantri, disciple of Tikkana and son of Tikkana Mantri,
PURANAS AND ITIHASAS                                             17

his brother, was the author of an adaptation of the Sanskrit
Markandeya Purana in mixed verse and prose. He dedicated it to
Nagaya Gannaya, a military officer of Pratapa Rudra II (1295—
 1326).
   Nachana Soma, Avho lived 30 years after Errapragada (about
1360), is one of the best poet» of this period. He is the author of
Utlara Harivamsamuand Vasanta Vilasamu\ the former is a free trans¬
lation of Harivamsam, but though Puranic in theme, it exhibits
the beginnings of the prabandha technique, and the latter is in.
complete prabandha pattern. Veercsalingam is much enamoured
of Nachana Soma’s Uttara Harivamsam. He is strongly of the
opinion that it is a better production than Errapragada Harivamsam
and that Nachana Somana excels Nannaya and Tikkana also in
some respects, particularly in the matter of style and language,
poetic conceptions, homely expressions and a charming presenta¬
tion of the dramatic situations and incidents. I think Veercsa¬
lingam arrived at a correct estimate of Somana’s poetic art. There
are many interesting stories in this poem, such as Usha Parinayam
and Narakasura Vadha. Nachana earned the title of Sarvajna
which he richly deserved on account of his poetic art and high
scholarship. A copper plate inscription, unearthed rccendy,
shows that Bukka Devaraya of Vijayanagara kingdom donated
a village to him (along with five more Brahmans) in 1376 as a reward
for his literary work.
   Vemulavada Bhimakavi seems to be a very resourceful poet,
gifted with wit and humour, but his life story is mixed up with
myth and miracle. There are stray verses of his in some later
anthologies, but none of his works has been preserved to posterity.
There is also much controversy about his date and residence.
   Madiki Singana (1420) was the author of Vasishtha Ramaymam
and Padma Puranam, Jakkana (1406—1422) of Vikramarka Charitra^
Anantamatya (1430) of Bhojarajiyamy Rasabharanam, and Chhando*
darpanamy relating to prosody and grammar, also known as Ananta*s
Chandas, There are some other important poets of this period
of Puranas and Itihasas prior to Srinatha and Bammera Potana.

Age of Srinatha and Potana (1380—1500)
   Srinatha and Potana: In the case of these two poets also, there
have been controversies regarding their abode, their mutual
relationship and the time during which they lived. I cannot
    2
 18                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE


 enumerate them here, but shall state the latest views which, in
 my opinion, are sound. The late Chaganti Scihayya is a recent
 scholar who published his Andhra Kavi Tarangini in several volumes.
 In the fifth volume he discussed at length the points relating to
 Srinatha’s date of birth, the events of his life and his demise—
as between 1380 and 1445. In the sixth volume he discussed
 the time of Potaiia and came to the conclusion that he must have
lived between 1450 and 1510. If these dates are accepted, tradi¬
 tional stories that Srinatha and Potana were brothers-in-law,
 that Srinatha urged Potajja in vain to dedicate his Bhagavatam
 to Sarvajna Singa Bhupala of Warangal and similar stories can
 no longer stand scrutiny. It is moic imiiortant for the general
reader to know what they wrote, and what place they occupy in
Telugu literature.
    Srinatha was a renowned scholar, well versed in Sanskrit,
Prakrit and Telugu. He held an important position under Verna
Reddi (1400—1420), corresponding to that of a Director of Public
Instruction and Chief Kxamincr. He commenced poetic composi¬
tion early in his teens. He was a prolific writer with about thirteen
works to his credit, some of which arc standard classics in Telugu
literature, and the rest delight the ordinary reader. He defeated
Arunagirinatha, a great scholar bearing the title of Dindima Bhat,
in the court of Praudha Devaraya of Vijayanagar in a contest of
scholarship and polemical discourses, and caused that scholar's
Dindima — a kind of drum sounded to announce his visit to the
royal court — broken. This was indeed an extraordinary victory
for a scholar in the presence of a king known widely in those days
for learning and liberal patronage. He was literally * bathed
in gold ’ by that king — the most ample reward for an indigent
scholar. He was honoured in many other courts and welcomed
wherever he went. His was a triumphal tour all over the Telugu
country. But he was subject to several turns of the wheel of
fortune. During his last days he lived in abject poverty, because
his patrons were cither dead or vanquished in battle.
    He lived in the period of ‘ Puranas and Itihasas * and in the
wake of his predecessors, rendered Sanskrit kavyas into Telugu.
But his translation of Sri Harsha’s Naishadhakavya was not just
literal. A fastidious critic like Akkiraju Umakantam pointed
to some defects in it, but he recognised the merit of Kasikhandam
and Bkimesvarapurmam and even remarked that they appeared
PURANAS AND ITIHASAS                                               19

 like original kavyas and the Sanskrit originals as adaptations
 from Srinatha. Haravilasofn is his best work. It is known as a
 kathaprabandha of fcmr typical and interesting stories relating to
  Lord Siva, of which the story of Chirutonda Nambi, a Vysya
  devotee of Siva, is of great literary merit and worthy of being
 translated into Sansloit an(J Hindi to serve as a specimen of
 Srinatha’s poetic skill. Srinalha’s Kridabhiramam (also known as
  Vithi-Tiatakam), though vulgar at some places exhibits the poet’s
 wide range of experience and his keen insight into the varied
 phases of the life of all classes of peofde of his age. It introduced
 only two cliaractcrs in the narrativS, one who narrates and another
 w'ho listens to the cliarming descriptions of the several scenes of
 social life at \\'araiigal. There are also many chatu or stray verses
 in Tclugu attributed to Srinatha, most of ^v•hich resemble, in
 diction, style a id ‘'CtiTiment, the verses of this romantic poem.
    Pandit Uniakantam extols Srinatha’s l^alanati Vira Charitra^
 a popular ballaii in the desi metre kno\vn as manjari {dvipada
 without prasa)^ and thinks that it is the best of not only Srinatha’s
 works but also in the field of Tclugu literature of this period, on
 account of its originality in theme and composition. Pandit
 Umakautam says that an original poem exhibits the genuine
 poetic genius and poetic diction of the author much better
than stilted translations or adaptations. The theme of this ballad,
being the history of a fratricidal war of the latter part of the
 12th ceiilnry, invites favourable comparison with the theme
of the Mahabharata. 'Phe heroes of Palanad exhibit valour,
courage and integrity like the I'amoiis heroes of the Mahabharata,
and there are characters of divergent natures in both. The
development of the story and the descriptions of the scenes and
situations in this ballad exhibit the poetic art of a perfect nature
and highly talented artist. But some pandits tvho admire Sanskrit
compounds and obsolete expressions look down upon this poem,
and they argue tliat Srinatha who composed Xaishadham in such a
high flo^vn style, presenting the appearance of Sanskrit rather
than Tclugu, could not have condescended to ^vrite a simple
ballad like Palanafi Vita Charitra in such a popular diction violating
the rules of old grammar. Pandit Umakantam discounts the
artificial standards set up by such pandits and expounds the real
values of poetic art which he noticed in this ballad.
   Srinatlia ^vas a versatile genius. , He could silence his rivals
20                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURK


among scholars with his learned arguments, command the respect
of his patrons by his personality, and spontaneous outburst of
poetry, and praise them without compromising his dignity. He
 could at the same time befriend the common folk through his
ready wit and humour which, though caustic at times, delighted
the listeners. I’hc sentiment of k^ye pervades his works and
assumes prominent hues when the occasion is favourable for its
expression. He became so popular in this sphere that stray
erotic verses, the authorship of which is not known, are generally
attributed to him, provide^ they have poetic merit. He is an
adept in using apt figures of spfeech and in embellishing language
with stylistic ornaments.
   His works in general and his Sivaratri Alahalmyam in particular
show that he could also be grouped along with Nannichoda,
Mallikarjuna Panditaradhya and Palakuriki Somana as a Saivite
poet. But his devotion to Siva was not of a fanatical or dogmatic
nature. It is even doubtful if he experienced in actual life the
religious fervour which he exhibited in his compositions.

Bammera Polana (1450—1510)
   A real devotee in thought, word and deed was Bammera Potana
always associated with the Bhagavatam^ his masterpiece. It is,
no doubt, an adaptation of the Sanskrit Bhagavata^ but scholars,
who have closely studied both the Sanskrit and I’elugu versions-
express the opinion that Potana’s Bhagavatam excels the Sanskrit
Bhagavata in many places by virtue of its poetic art. Like all
 other translations or adaptations, Potana’s also has some omissions
 and commissions and deviations from the original. But in the
 case of Potana the Telugu reader is not at all worried about them.
 Every episode which he presented is an interesting poem, complete
in itself, and his piety is reflected in every verse. Readers as well
 as those who hear it read are miraculously carried away by his^
 enchanting description and narration, and the poetic beauties
appeal to the classes and the masses alike. The right word in the
right place, a simile most appropriate to the occasion, a sentiment
that is shared by one and all, and a felicity of phrase which evokes
beautiful thoughts, arc some of the prominent features of Potana’s
poetry. Even the staunch atheist will be easily converted to faith
in God when he reads Potana’s Prahlada Charitra or Gajendrct
Moksham or Dhruvopakhyanam.
PURANAS AND ITIHASAS                                             21

    Even those that have never heard the names of Potana and
Bhagavata are familiar with many verses from his Gajendra Moksham
 and other parts of his Bhagavalum. Devotees - leticrccl and unlet¬
 tered—memorise select verses from Gajendra Moksham and recite
 them every morning along with their prayers. A beautiful song
 was composed in the last century by Kanukolanu Venkata Dasa
 with the very words of Potana and a refrain (chorus or burden
of the song) which means “O! Rajendra, listen to the story of
 how Gajendra had his release from* the dangerous grip of the
crocodile”. Rukmini Kalyanam, an episode relating to the marriage
of Rukmini, is very popular with girls who memorise it with
delight and are nev^er wearied of reciting it,
    Potana is not, however, the sole author of the complete Bhaga-
vatam. The major part of it was done by him but a few other
parts were rendered by his disciples—Veligandala Narayya,
Gaiiganarya and Erchuri Singana. There is a traditional story
to account for this plurality of authors. It says that Potana
wrote it completely and refused to dedicate it to Sarvajna Singa
Bhupala of IVarangal in spite of the latter’s requests and threats.
Potana dedicated it to Lord Rama with his usual devotion to God.
Singa Bhupala felt insulted and had the complete manuscript
buried underground. When, later on, it was unearthed parts
of it had been eaten away by worms, and therefore, those parts
that were so destroyed had to be retranslated by Potana’s disciples.
But the story is the type of an aetiological myth. Sarvajna Singa
Bhupala was a Sanskrit scholar devoted to Sanskrit learning and
never cared for any Telugii poem, however great it might be;
nor was he so narrow-minded or %vicked as to perpetrate such a
disgraceful crime. As in the case of the Mahabharata and the
Ramayana probably it was not easy to have the whole of it done
by one poet. Potana might have taken up the best and most
interesting portions of the w’ork and left the rest to be done by his
pupils. There is of course mtich difference between his masterly
style and the kind of style exhibited by others. A peculiar melodi¬
ous run, a pleasing rhythm, a happy turn of expression, an appro¬
priate mode of stylistic ornament, are some of the peculiar traits
of Potana’s composition. From a mixed anthology of a thousand
verses, it is always possible to mark out those that are Potana’s.
   Bhogitti Dandakam and Virabhadra Vijayam are said to be the
other works of Potana. The former is an eulogy in praise of
 22                                 history of tei-ugu literature

  Bhogini, a courtesan of Singa Bhupala. Probably he composed
  it in his early youth before he developed devotion to God and
  aversion to tlie vanity of human wishes.
     There is a traditional story about the composition of Virabhadra
  Vijnyam by Potana. It says that Petana while praising Vishnu
 made some statements derogatory to the greatness of Siva; he
 repented later, and as an expiatory oflering, composed Virabhadra
  Vijqyam in praise of Siva. But this story is not credible, because
 the composition of Virabhadra Vijqyam has errors of language and
 is of poor quality compared with that of Bhagavatnm. If it was really
 composed by Potana, it should have been done long before the
Bhagavatam. Some scholars are inclined to say that it was not
 Potana’s work at all.
    Potana no^v'here mentions the name of his guru and he describes
his scholarship as ‘ self-acquired ’ by using the expression, Sahaja
Panditya. It is quite possible for one like Potana to be so gifted
by nature. His faith in God strengthened his self-reliance and
his devotion to God developed devotion to learning. Potana
used expressions that came into use in his time, though they trans¬
gressed the rules of old grammar. Some pandits characterise
them as faults, without realising that the grammar should be revised
so as to provide a place for such newly developed forms. And
they ought to commend Potana’s usage.

 Some other Poets of this Period
    Pillalamarri Pina Virabhadra is a poet of eminence in this
 period. He belonged to the last part of the 15th century. He
 wrote several poems but only two have come down to posterity.
 1. Sakuntala Parinayam and 2. Jaimini Bharatam. The former is^
based on the episode in the Mahabharata and on the development
of the theme in Kalidasa’s drama, Abhijnanasakwitalam, but the
 author has introduced a few deviations from both of them and
combined the dramatic situations to enhance the beauty of his
poem. For example, if in the Mahabharata, akasavani helped
Dushyanta recognise his wife when she approached- him in his
palace, Kalidasa introduced the ring to help his memory. Pina
Virabhadra made use of both the devices. His Jaimini Bharatanv
is adapted from Asvamedha Parva^ according to i^ie version of Jaimini
but not of Vyasa, because the former contains more episodes than
the latter. The author is a highly talented poet with spontaneity
FURANAS AND ITIHASAS                                              23

 of expression so that he could compose his poems with great
 facility. In an introductory verse in Sakuntala Parinqyam, a refer¬
 ence was made to three types of themes for a poem — a well known
 episode from purana or ilihasa, a fictitious story and a mixed
 one, and the first was characterised by him as the best.      That
 was the ideal of the day.
    Nandi Mallaya and his sister’s son, Ghanta Singaya, jointly
 translated into Telugu verse, as a champu poem, Prabodha Chandro^
 dayam, (1480) a Sanskrit allegorical pl^y of Krishna Misra. It is
curious that Telugu poets, either of this period or of the next two
 periods, never thought of writing dramas of the type of Sanskrit
plays in Telugu — either original plays or translations. It is
still more curious that these t^vo poets as well as Pina Virabhadra,
though they drew upon Sanskrit dramas for the material of their
Kavyas did not think of translating them as dramas but chose to
render them as champu kavyas,      Mallaya and Singana also com¬
posed in mixed verse and prose, Varaha Puranam (1485—90),
as an adaptation from the original in Sanskrit and dedicated it
to Narasimha Deva (1456—1491), father of Krishnadevaraya.
    Dubagunta Narayana Kavi (1450—1500) wrote during the last
decade of the 15th century Panchatantram, an adaptation from the
original in Sanskrit. This poem is in simple, refined and melodious
language, and it delights the reader with interesting stories con¬
taining maxims of universal interest.

 Tallapaka Annamacharya (1408—1503)
   To the reader who feels fed up with too many accounts of
translations and adaptations from Sanskrit puranas or kavyas^
comes as a welcome relief Tallapaka Annamacharya, whose long
life of 95 years covers almost the whole of the 15th century a.d.
He belonged to a family of scholars of oriental learning that came
to Tirupati and settled dotvn there. He is regarded as the father
of a new branch of Telugu literature — lyrico-devotional songs,
all addressed to the Deity, Sri Venkateswara of Tirupati. After
acquiring adequate knowledge of Sanskrit and Telugu in his
boyhood, Annamacharya commenced the composition of his
songs. The number of the songs which he composed in both
Sanskrit and Telugu is 32,000, an astounding number! It works
out at one song per day continuously for about 88 years! In
addition to these songs, he composed a sataka of 105 verses addressed
 24                               HISTORY OF TELUaU UTERATURE

  to Lord Venkatcswara and probably some other {K)enis like Ven^
 katachala Mahatmyam and Dvipada Ramayanam which have been
 lost. What a prolific writer!
    We find among these songs several varieties, such as cradle
 songs, amorous dialogues between ,,Lord Venkateswara and his
 consorts, the sweet warblings of parrots, bees, and cuckoos, moon¬
light ditties, etc., — indeed all the varieties we now find in the
folk-songs of the Telugu country.
    Annamacharya was not only a poet but also a profound musician;
he wrote Samkirtana Lakshanam\ a treatise on the technique of the
 composition of devotional songs. He could also sing them so
 melodiously that he attracted crowds to listen \vith devotion and
rapture. His songs are valued for the variety of ragas or melodies
 they display, and for their devotional concepts and literary merit.
    It is related how he sent for his son, Peda Tirumalayya, to his
bedside before he expired and expressed his desire that he should
also dedicate his life to the composition of devotional songs, and
how like a devoted son Peda Tirumalayya continued his father’s
literary work. He belongs to the next period in the history of
Telugu literature. Timmakka, the first wife of Annamacharya
was a poetess, the deatils of whose xvorks are furnished under the
heading of “ Poetesses ”.
    Literature relating to Saivism did not fade out with the rise
of the Vaishnava cult. It had its strongliold in the Rayalaseema
districts and a part of the old Hyderabad State. Disciples of Pala-
kuriki Somana carried on the propaganda through their poems.
What they wrote was, however, like old wine in new bottles-
 Of Somalia’s disciples, the Pidupartis (of Picliiparru in Hyderabad
 State) were prominent. Piduparti Basavayya (1420—1440) wrote
Gurudiksha Prabodham, the story of Pilla Nainar and Brahmottara
Khandam. His son Piduparti Somanatha Kavi wrote (1480)
Basava Puranam as a kavya using various metres. The theme is
the same as in Palakuriki Somana’s famous dvipada poem. In
accordance with the wish of his father, Piduparti Somanatha
dedicated his kavya to the memory of Palakuriki. ^ He did not
discard dvipada metre; he used it for another of his poems,
Prabhulinga Lila,
    Piduparti Somanatha’s younger brother’s son is another Basava.
Just as Somanatha recast Palakuriki Somana’s dvipada kavya
into a mixed padya kavyat this Basava recast Somanatha’s Prabhu»
PURANA8 AND ITIHASAS                                              25

linga Lila into a similar padya kavya in about 1510. As in Potana’s
case, his composition is also said to be faulty because he violated
the rules of old grammar. It is a pity that some pandits do not
realise that they have to revise their grammar in accordance
with the usage of important poets. They forget the significance
of the fundamental principles of grammar — that grammar
should follow prayogam or usage, which in its turn follows what is
current in the country.
   We find humanist and egalitarian concepts in Saiva literature
and to some extent in Vaishnava literature also; but they under¬
went modification with the growing influence of orthodox
Hinduism and inequalities in social status, caste and creed developed
again.
   There were several other poets of note but I have no space for
them here. This period, though mainly a period of translations
or adaptations of puranas and itihasaSj witnessed the beginnings
of the future trends in Telugu literature. Except in the case of
Palanaii Vira Charitra by Srinatlia, and Annamacharya’s devotional
songs and salakas (centuries of verses) there was very little of
originality either in thought or theme in the works of this period,
though there might be genuine flashes of the poetic art in several
poems. No prose literature of this period has been transmitted
to posterity. Either it was not attempted or it was not preserved
because it was done in the popular language and not in poetic
diction.
                         CHAPTER III

                    The Prabandha Period

We now proceed to the Augustan Age in Telugu literature which
is affectionately designated as the Rayala Tugam because it com¬
menced with Krishnadevaraya (1503—1530) and his court-poets,
of whom Allasani Peddana was the poet-laureate. The prabandha
type of literature was the ideal during this period. Poets vied
with one another in producing prabandhas ^vhich could be appre¬
ciated by pandits and rewarded by patrons. There was no
dearth of either poets or patrons. Krishnadevaraya, the Emperor
of the Vijayanagar empire, was the richest and the most liberal
patron of literature and art. His court, therefore, attracted
scholars and poets from all corners of Telugu country. The
Emperor himself was a great scholar and poet. He was well-
versed in Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada. He composed many
Sanskrit works though none of them has been preserved; his
Amuktamalyada, a Telugu prabandha, is a high-class poem, with
a sacred theme stimulating faith in Lord Vishnu. Its ornate
style commands the admiration and regard of scholars and poets;
its poetic conceits and descriptions of men and of tlic phenomena
of nature illustrate the author’s powers of imagination and keen
observation. It is surprising that the ruler of a vast empire, with
problems at home and wars abroad, could find time to compose
such a great prabandha. And this was not his only literary work.
He is said to have also written in Sanskrit Madalasa Charitra, Satya-
vadJhuprinanam^ Sakala Kathasara Sangridiam, Jnanachintamani and
Rasamanjari. It is a pity that none of these books has been pre¬
served for us; but we have these names mentioned in an intro¬
ductory verse of Amuktamalyada.
   Corresponding to the niahakavyas in Sanskrit, viz., Kalidasa s
Raghuvamsam and Kumarasambhavamy Bharavi s Kiratarjuniyarn,
Magha’s Sisupalavadha and Sri Harsha’s JSfaishadham, five poems
are regarded as mahakavyas in Telugu, viz., Svarochishamanu*
sambhavamy more popularly known as Manucharitramy by Allasani
Peddana,      Amuktamalyada (also known as Vishnuchittiyam) by
Krishnadevaraya, Vasucharitram by Bhattumurti (who is also known
THE PRABANDHA PERIOD                                             27

as Ramarajabhushana), Sringara Maishadhani by Srinatha, and
Pandurangamahatmyam by Tenali Ramakrishna. There are, how¬
ever, some scholars who mention Pingali Surana’s Kalapumodayam
in the place of Pandurangamahatmyam^ while some others mention
 Vijayavilasam by Chemakura Venkata Kavi. This shows that the
seven poems enumerated above arc regarded as the best in Tclugu
literature. Of these Srinatha’s Sringara Naishadham has already
been noticed in the previous section, as it belongs to the period of
translations. It is interesting to note l^at while it is known as
Naishadham in Sanskrit, it is named as Sringara Naishadham in
Telugu because Srinatha ^vith his fondness for the sentiment of
love emphasised it and translated only that part of the poem,

Sri Krishnadevaraya: Amuktamalyada
   The authorship of Amuktamalyada has been a matter of contro¬
versy among scholars. Some are disposed to think that Peddana,
the poet-laureaie of Krishnadevaraya, was iis real autiior and that
it was surrendered to the royal patron. The only argument
adduced to justify this allegation is that some verses found in
Peddana’s Manucharitram are also found in Amuktamalyada. They
relate to the conquests of Krishnadevaraya and, in all probability,
Krishnadevaraya quoted them from Peddana’s poem instead of
composing verses extolliiig his own valour. There is such a
marked difference in style and language betAveen Amuktamalyada
and Manucharitra that one who carefully reads both the poems will
come to the conclusion that they could never have been the produc¬
tions of the same author. Peddana never cared for the type of
involved constructions, and the uneven and highly ornate style
found in Amuktamalyada. There are also some unusual merits in
Amuktamalyada which we find but rarely in Peddana’s Manucharitra^
such as powerful poetic conceits, vivid descriptions of human
behaviour and of the phenomena of nature. Peddana was not
incapable of compo.sing such verses if only he cared to.
   In the introductory part of his Amuktamalyada, Krishnadevaraya
tells us that   was encouraged to compose this poem when he Avas
on his way to Kalinga. Camping at VijayaAvada, he visited thc-
temple of Andhra Vishnu situated at Srikakulam near Vijayawada.
During his stay there, the Deity, announcing himself as Andhra:
Nayaka, appeared in a dream and exhorted him thus:
28                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE


          Compose a poem in Telugu describing my marriage
     at Srirangam with Amuktamalyada, the damsel who was
     offering a garland of flowers for my decoration. I want
     you to do it in Telugu, because the country is Telugu and
     I am the Telugu Lord. And,since you have conversed
     with several kings in their own languages when they came
     to pay you their respects, you must have noticed that
     Telugu is the best of the regional languages. Dedicate
     your poem to Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati, because we
     arc the same, though we' assume different forms and arc
     known by different names.”

  Krishnadevaraya amplified the story with the antecedents of
Amuktamalyada and of her foster-father Vishnuchitta. Tlie
poem is, therefore, known after their names, as Amuktamalyada
and Vishnuchittiyam. This was composed later than Peddana’s
Manucharitram.

Peddana: Manucharitram
   Peddana, the poet-laureate of Krishnadevaraya, is considered
to be one of the greatest poets in Telugu, and his Manucharitram
as the best of the panchamahakavyams enumerated above. Peddana
survived his royal patron as is evident from one of his chatu or
stray verses, wherein he describes how lofty was the esteem in
which the poet was held by the monarch. He recalls, with intense
fervour, a memorable incident on the day of the dedication of his
Manucharitram to the king: when Peddana was seated in a palanquin
for the ceremonial procession, Krishnadevaraya held the pole
with his own hand and lifted the palanquin, the greatest homage
that could be paid by a royal patron to a poet! Peddana tells
us that he was usually addressed by the king as Andhra Kavita
Pilamaha Allasani Peddanarya (Grandsire of Telugu poetry).
   The nucleus of the story of Manucharitram is an episode in Markan-
deyapurana relating to the birth of Svarochisha Manu, one of the
fourteen Manus. The story is narrated in about ,150 vctscs in
Markandeyapurana^ as translated by Marana. Peddana elaborated
the theme, and composed a lengthy mahakavya of six cantos and
six hundred verses. He had, besides amplifying the story, to
ip>bservc all the features of a prabandha. The story begins with
Rn incident in the life of Pravara, a learned and pious Brahman
the prabandha period                                              29

 youth. A sadhu who visited his house gave him a miraculous
 ointment which, when applied to his feet, would take him to any
 place he desired to see. Pravara tested its efficacy and went to the
 Himalayas one forenoon, but could not return because the ointment
 melted away with the heat of the sun and the effect of the charm
 vanished. When he was in a perplexed state of mind, Varudhini,
 a gandharva damsel of extraordinary beauty, fell in love with him
 aiad invited him to her abode nearby. But Pravara was too
 puritanical to yield to her charms and rqccted her advances.
 He then returned home with the help of the God of Fire whom he
invoked. A gandharva youth who flad been courting Varudhini
in vain observed this situation, and assuming the form of Pravara>
succeeded in winning her. Svarochi was the result of their union
and later, Svarochi begot Svarochishamanu. The most popular
portion of Manucharitra relates to Pravara, Varudhini and the false
Pravara while the rest of the poem, which contains the main story
of Manu’s birth, is often neglected by readers in general. It is
something like Kalidasa’s Kumarasambhava, in which what relates
to Parvati and Siva is more interesting than the story connected
directly with the birth of Kumara.
   In Manucharitra^ language appropriate to the characters of the
story is throughout consistently maintained. Almost every verse
exhibits a figure of speech. The stylistic ornaments, such as
alliteration and rhyme, are not excessive; indeed they enhance the
charm of the verse. Descriptions are quite natural. Very rarely
do we come across a verse which is heavily loaded with Sanskrit
compoimds extending over two or more lines. The poem as a
whole has a well balanced, even flow, with natural and vivid
descriptions of all the eighteen items required for a prd^andha type
of mahakavj/af none of which seems to be out of tune or out of place.
   It is said that the court of Krishnadevaraya was adorned by
eight poets who were like the Ashta Diggajas—the elephants at the
eight cardinal points of the earth. The traditional list of those
eight poets is: 1. Allasani Peddana, author of Alanucharitrai
2. Nandi Timmana, author of Parijatapaharanam; 3. Ayyalaraju
Ramabhadru^u, author of Ramabhyudayami 4. Dhurjati, author of
Kalahastisvara Mahatmyam\ 5. Madayagari Mallana, author of
Rqjasekkarackaritram; 6. Pingali Surana, author of Kalapumodayam;
7. Bhattumurti, also known as Ramarajabhushana, author of
Vasuekaritra and 8. Tenali Ramakrishna, author of Pandurangs
 30                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE


 Mahatmyam. But Pingali Surana and Ramarajabhushana did
not really belong to this period. Recently it has b^en established^
on the authority of an inscription, that these two should be replaced
by Chintalapudi Yellana, author oiRadhamadhavaniy and Kandukuri
Rudra Kavi author of J^iratikusopakhyanam. Ayyalaraju Rama-
bhadra Kavi was only a promising young poet in the time of
Krishnadevaraya. It is related of him diat he was asked by the
king to compose Sakala Kathasara Sangraham but that he could not
finish it before the king’s death in 1530. Tallapaka Chinnanna
who composed Ashtamahishi Kalyanam in dvipada metre and was
rewarded by the king is not lAentioned among the ashta diggajas.

jYandi Timmana : Parijatapaharanam
   Parijatapaharanam by Nandi I’immana is a beautiful poem with
 melodious verses and an interesting theme taken from the Harivamsa,
 The sage Narada, according to the story, brought a parijata flower
from the nandarana (garden of heaven) and presented to Krishna
in the presence of his chief consort Rukmini. The flower was then
offered by Krishna to Rukmini. When Satya, noted for her
pride and jealousy among Krishna’s wives, came to know of it,
she was enraged and retired to her “ house of resentment         She
refused to be appeased by Krishna and even when he bowed at
her feet, she let her left foot touch his head. When at last Krishna
promised to bring down from svarga the Parijata tree itself and
plant it in her garden, she felt happy. Krishna went to svarga and
secured the divine tree after a fight with Indra. Timmana was
the creator of a typical character in Satya, more popularly known
as Satya Bhama, who subsequently became the celebrated heroine
of the typical dance dramas of Andhra Desa.

Ramabhadra Kavi: Sakalakathasara Sangraham
   Ayyalaraju Ramabhadra Kavi in response to Krishnadevaraya’s
request wrote Sakalakathasara Sangraham^ a collection of several
stories of the past. It has no high poetic quality, but his Rama-
hhyudayam composed in the time of Ramaraja in about 1550, is
considered to be a poem of great merit. His verses are over-loaded
with stylistic ornaments, and some of them contain expressions that
are repeated a second time with a different meaning.
THB PRABANDHA PERIOD                                              31

Dhurjati: Kalahasti Mahatmyam
   Dhurjati, another court-poet of Krishnadevaraya, wrote Sri
Kalahasti Mahatmyam and Sri Kalahastisvara Satakamy both of which
are praised for melody of expression, loftiness of sentiment and
pleasing poetical conceits. Dhurjati’s grandson, known as Kumara
Dhurjati, was an equally greajt poet; he composed in about 1550
Krishnadevaraya Vijayam as a chronicle of the military exploits and
conquests of Krishnadevaraya. It is, therefore, valued as a fine
piece of literature and also as a source of history. He also composed
another poem known as Indumatiparinayam and dedicated it to
Narasimha Apparaya, a chieftain »ff I^uzvid. The theme of the
poem is based on the story of Indumati, sister of Bhoja, king of
Vidarblia, who fell in love with prince Aja (son of Raghu) and
chose him for her husband at her svayamvara. This poem has
interesting descriptions of forests, hunting, and festivals. What
relates to the Chenchus and hunting is very charming. The language
used is melodious, with appropriate stylistic ornaments and figures
of speech. The social life of the Telugus is skilfully depicted
wherever references are made to the social activities of the people.

Madayagari Mallana: Rajasekhara Charitram
   Madayagari Mallana, another court-pjoct of Krishnadevaraya,
wrote in about 1515 Rajasekhara Charitram which deserves a high
place in Telugu literature. Mallana had the privilege of
accompanying Krishnadevaraya in his military campaigns, along
with Allasani Peddana and Nandi Timmana. Even during the
wars, the king used to spend his leisure hours in the company of
the poets. Rajasekhara Charitra narrates the exploits of prince
Rajasekhara, son of Hemadhanva of Avanchipura, which ultimately
led to his marriage with Kantimati through the mediation of a
parrot possessing a knowledge of the past, present and future
events and, therefore, known as trikalavedi. The origin of the
story could not be traced to any known episode of any purana.
Probably it was an original story conceived by Mallana himself.
There is nothing very extraordinary in the story. It could not be
developed yithout supernatural supports. Though it started
with a chivalrous exploit, there was a break in the middle of the
story and the romantic aspect of the story was rather flat without
any thrill. But the erotic sentiment was kept within the limits
of propriety and decorum, unlike some other poems of the age.
 32                                  HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE


 The language is simple and idiomatic and the styl^ is dignified
 and mostly ornamented.

  Pingali Surana: Kalapumodayam
     Pingali Surana (1520-80) is admittedly one of the best poets
  in Telugu literature. I should like to give him the first place
  among them and I am sure that there are many scholars who
  agree with me. He had profound scholarship in Sanskrit and
  Telugu, wonderful spontaneity of expression, high poetical talent,
  and an astounding imagina|ion with which he could create a very
  enthralling story, Kalapumodayam (1550). He presented it as a
  charming novel in verse, of which each episode is quite original
  and complete in itself and yet connected with the main story.
  The author introduced well-known characters of ancient lore and
  puranic fame such as Brahma, Sarasvati, Krishna, Jambavati,
  Nalakubara, Rambha etc. to produce the illusion that the story
 might have been adopted from some episodes in the Puranas.
 He begins the story with Kalabhashini, a damsel of Dvaraka, and,
  concealing her antecedents, brings her to prominence througli
 unexpected contacts with Narada and Manikandhara, a
 gandharva, and with Rambha and Nalakubara,              and develops
 the story through a series of surprises. The reader’s interest is
 aroused at every turn, and he is encouraged to read on with a
 lively expectation. Narada and Manikandhara visit the palace
 of Krishna at Dvaraka, and Kalabhashini accompanies them, but
 the purpose of this visit is not then revealed. Manikandhara
 desires to sport with Rambha, and Kalabhashini with Nalakubara.
 A tempting opportunity was dexterously planned, with the result
 that there was a comedy of errors but not the actual fulfilment of
their desires. Kalabhashini assumes the form of Rambha and
joins Manikandhara, who had already assumed the form of
Nalakubara. The real Rambha enters upon the scene and disputes
with the false Rambha and ultimately drives her away when the
 latter fails to accept her challenge. She then sits by the side of the
false Nalakubara, mistaking him for the real one. Later on, the
real Nalakubara comes and disputes with the falser Nalakubara
and ultimately drives him away when he fails to stand a decisive
test. Certain revelations arc then made. A wonderful episode
relating to Sugatri and Salina, narrated earlier 4n the poem enters
in^p the development of the main theme at this stage, through a
the prabandha period                                              33

miraculous march of events. All have rebirths. Kalabhashini is
 born as Madalasa, and Salina and Sugratri are born again with
changes in sex; Kalapurna, their son, marries Madalasa and
 becomes the hero of the final phase of the story. It is in the fifth
canto that Madalasa, under the influence of a charm, reveals the
origin of the story. Brahma and Sarasvati once had an amorous
alliance which resulted in Sarasvati falling into a fret. She
 turned away from Brahma and both happened to be lying on a
raised floor on the edge of a pleasure pond, facing a pillar in the
middle of the pond. Brahma, to \^hile away the time, narrated
a story—quite a fictitious allegory referring to their own affair as
reflected in the pillar opposite to them. The parrot who was
present narrated this incident to Rambha when later she visited
the abode of Sarasvati. It was felt as a great offence and Sarasvati
cursed the parrot to die and be reborn as a damsel on earth; and
that was Kalabhashini. Brahma then said that the fictitious
story narrated by him would come true, and thus we have the
story as the outcome of Brahma’s verdict.
   Kalapurnoday am is really a mahakavya with the technical features
required of a prabandha worked out in an artistic manner. Pingali
Surana’s Prabhavati Pradyumnam (1555) is an adaptation of an
episode in Harivamsa and is not, therefore, an original story. But
as a work of art it may be given a higher place. It relates to the
story of Prabhavati, daughter of an all-powerful Asura, Vajranabha
by name. She loved and ultimately married Pradyumna, son of
Lord Krishna. Though the theme was borrowed, the development
of the story was achieved through a dexterous plot as in a drama.
   Raghava Pandaviyam (1545) was an earlier composition of Pingali
Surana’s. There is not much of poetic merit in it, but it is
renowned as the first dvyarthi kavya in Telugu literature. It may
be read as narrating the story of the Ramayana as well as the
Alahabharata. It was composed in imitation of the Sanskrit
poem of the same name by Kaviraja. Some words have twa
meanings and some compounds may be split in two ways
as is illustrated in the following example: Karnabhishmokodanda
guru pratapa oan be interpreted as applying to the story of either
Alahabharata or Ramayana. Kama, Bhishma and Kodanda
guru (Dronacharya) are heroes of Alahabharata. Karna-bhishma
means dreadful to the ear; kodanda gurupratapa may be interpreted
as the great valour of the bow man to suit the story of Rama.

  Bkattumurti: Vasuehantra                             •
     fihattumurti also known as Ramarajabhushana since he was
  honoured by the king Ramaraja, is the author of Vasuehantra^ much
  praised and studied by scholars as affording a sound training in
 scholarship. An episode from the Mahabharata is developed into
 a lengthy poem of six cantos. It relates to the romantic amour
 of prince Vasu and his ultimate marriage with a princess, Girika,
 daughter of the river Suktimati and the mountain Kolahala.
 The poet exhibits his artistic skill in developing a simple plot with
 dramatic situations through his admirable command of Sanskrit
 and Telugu, and with his love for melodious and rhythmic flow
 of verse. The poem presents, in almost every verse, varying modes
 of stylistic ornaments and figures of speech. Expressions that
 admit of two different meanings are used to suit the occasion,
 particularly when comparisons are made. It is his masterpiece
 and one of the best poems in Telugu literature.
   This poem is held in such high esteem that, in the opinion of
Telugu scholars, one cannot claim to be a Telugu scholar, unless
one studied this great classic. But as this cannot be imderstood
 without a commentary, Somanathakavi (1650) of Lemulavada of
 Hyderabad region, wrote a masterly commentary known as,
 Vidvanmanoranjani and dedicated it to the deity, Rajesvarasvami
of Lemulavada. From this commentary we learn that Somanatha¬
kavi composed three poems, Chaturbhujabkishekam, Tadavacharitram
and Ganga Gauri Sanwadam, but these have not come to light.
Several poets have composed their poems imitating the style of
 Vasucharitram. Of them two are proxmnent: 1, Kanuparti
Abbayamatya (1750) and 2. Krishna Kavi (about (1750). The
former was the author of Aniruddha Charitra and Kaviraja mono*
ranjanamy of which the second, also known as Pururavascharitray is
regarded by scholars as Pilla Vasucharitra (smaller Vasucharitra),
as it contains many verses quite in imitation of those of Bhattu-
murti’s Vasucharitra. The latter, Krishna Kavi, composed Sakuhtala
Parinayam which is also known for similar reasons as another Pilla
 Vasucharitra. Though they are not by themselves highly renowned
poems, they proclaim the greatness of Vasucharitra. o
   Bhattumurti is also the author of Harischandra Nalopakhyanamy
a dvyarthi kavya like Raghava-Pandaviyam in which the stories of
Harischandra and Nala are narrated by the same set of verses.
There is much diflference between these two dvyarthi kavyas\ Raghava
THE PRABANDHA PERIOD                                             35
Fandaviyam is comparatively easier to understand, while Haris^
ihandra Nalopdkhyanamy on account of the out-of-the-way expressions
 and synonyms, is rather difficult to comprehend. Another work
 of Ramarajabhushana is J^arasabhupaliyam composed in Telugu
in imitation of Vidyanatha’s Prataparudriyam in Sanskrit. It
 relates to poetics.
    Surana and Ramarajabhushana are in one respect innovators.
As was indicated in an introductory verse in Pillalamarri Pinavira-
 bhadra’s Sakuntala Farinayam^ the theme for a standard kavya must
 be selected from a well-known epis»dc*mentioned in any purana
or history, the hero and the heroine of which belonged to the higher
classes of society. Surana had the boldness to make a heroine of
 Kalabhashini, though she was not mentioned in any well-known
 episode of puranic or historical fame. Scholars have not
 condemned Surana for this innovation, because he is a poet of
•extraordinary merit; they, therefore, find a justification: they
 urge that Kalabhashini is not an ordinary damsel but Sarasvati’s
 parrot in the previous birth, and all the important characters in
 the kavya are either deities or famous persons. Ramarajabhushana
 in an introductory verse in Vasucharitra refers to this problem of
 theme, and says that fabricated stories are like poor imitation
■* precious * stones; puranic episodes arc like raw materials from
the mines; and mixed stories arc like cut and polished diamonds
 and, therefore, the best. But classical poets subsequent to Surana
 and Ramarajabhushana somehow failed to follow the example set
By cither.

Tenali Ramakrishna
   Tenali Ramakrishna also known as Ramalinga, is the author
•of Panduranga Mahatmyam. Tradition says that he was one of the
court-poets of Krishnadevaraya. Several humorous stories and
oven mischievous pranks associated with his name arc current in
Southern India, and familiar to Kannadigas, Tamils and Malayalis
as well as to Telugus. He was at first a Saivile and known as
Ramalinga and, as all the traditional stories mention Ramalingam
and not Ranfhkrishna, they must relate to his early life, when he
was a Saivite. Later on, he embraced Vaishnavism and came to
be known as Ramakrishna. During tlic time he was a Saivite he
composed a poem known as Udbhataradhya Charitram, the biography
of Udbhata, a Saiva preceptor.
 36                                 HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

    Pandtiranga Mahatmyam was his masterpiece. It was probably
  composed after the demise of Krishnadevaraya when the poet
  resided at the coui't of Ramaraja.
    Ramakrishna is the author of another poem known as Ghatikachala
 Mahalmyam in which the greatness of Narasimha Kshetra near
 Sholingar in North Arcot District was described. We cannot
 definitely say whether this was his second or last composition.
 From the standpoint of literary merit, this may be regarded as
 his second composition. It may however be safely asserted that
 these Uvo poems Avere“ composed after he had embraced
 Vaishnavisrn.
    Pandtiranga Mahatmyam^ as the name indicates, is based on the
 legend about Panduranga of Pandarpur in Maharashtra. Rama¬
krishna kavi is known for his padagumbhntia, the art of framing
compound phrases pregnant with meaning, and for his simple
style and pure and elevating thoughts. An episode in it, the
JVigamasarmopakhyanam, is the finest and most widely read; but
towards the end it becomes a propagandist story, seeking to
emphasise the greatness of Pandarpur. A Brahman known as
Nigama Sarma led a dissipated and vicious life but died in
Pandarpur, far-famed as a holy place. When he died, the
messengers of Yama as well as of Vishnu came to take away hiS
soul. There was a dispute between them and finally it was taken
to the Vishnu loka because he died in a place dedicated to Vishnu I

  Other Poets
    Sankusala Nrisimha Kavi was probably a contemporary of
 Krishnadevaraya and Peddana. His Kavikarnarasayanam is a
 lengfthy poem in six cantos with a meagre story relating to the life
 of a Mandhatr, his devotion to Vishnu, his tapas (penance), intense
 absorption and trance, the visit of the servants of Lord Narayana,
 his march to Vaikuntha the abode of Lord Vishnu, and the Lord’s
 manifestation to Mandhatr. While the description of the tradi¬
 tional eighteen items satisfies the requirements of a prahandha^ this
 poet described about forty-five items, using all modes of stylistic
 ornaments and all figures of speech. He was conscious of his
 eminence as a poet and of the superiority of his prabandha. He
 claims, with evident satisfaction: “ An ascetic cannot but become
 a voluptuary on hearing my descriptions of the erotic sentiment in
'my kavya\ and a voluptuary cannot but become an ascetic on
 THE PRABANDHA PERIOD                                                 37

  hearing my descriptions of renunciation in my poem. ” Varied
  are the opinions of scholars about his greatness as a poet. Some
  give him a very high place along with Peddana, while others
  remark that they are fed up with his descriptions which were
  carried on ad nauseam.
     Chintalapudi Ellanarya (1’510—1560) was one of the ashta
  diggajas among the court-poets patronised by Krishnadevaraya.
  He,was the author of two poems: Radhamadhavam of five cantos and
  Tarakabrahmarajiyam, only four cantos of which have been preserved.
 Radhamadhavam was of a very high ^poetic merit and it attracted
  Krishnadevaraya who used to call liim Radhamadhava Kavi,
 instead of Ellanarya. His second \v’ork is a philosophical poem
 which is also regarded as a good classic. Both are appreciated
 for the poetical talent they display, and for melodious expression
 and attractive descriptions.     Radhamadhavam is certainly the more
 popular poem.
    Vemana is the autlior of what is popularly kno-wn as Vemana
 Satakam. His name is always associated with his verses, because
 the last line of each verse contains it in tlie vocative case “ Verna ”.
 Vemana’s veises express moral, religious, social, satirical and
 philosophical aphorisms in simple language. Most of them arc
 quite intelligible even to children, while their inner philosophical
 significance is understood more and more as age and experience
 advance. A statement is made in the first two lines, and it is
followed by an analogous example in the third line, which some¬
times extends to a part of the fourth line. The fourth line is
devoted completely or in part to the name Verna which is used as
a refrain, e.g., Visvadabhiramal vinura Vernal (Vinura means
listen).
    Vemana’s verses have been widely popular all over the country.
It is related of Vemana that he led a profligate life in his youth and
that he suddenly developed a feeling of repugnance to it. He
then became an ascetic and began to think aloud. Probably he
received some education in his boyhood and listened to the puranas,
usually read to the people during nights, and learnt the art of
composing verses. He spoke in numbers, because numbers came
to him not because he desired to win recognition as a poet. He
never committed any verse of his to writing. When, as an ascetic,
he wandered over the country, young men flocked round him and
some of them constantly followed him as his disciples. And,
38                                   HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE


when they listened to the thought           uttered impromptu, theyr
recorded the verses as they were uttered.
  There are thousands of Telugus who can recite Vemana’s
verses, and it is not an exaggeration to say that there is hardly any
I’elugu person who has not heard of Vemana’s name or listened
to at least a few verses of his.   They attracted the oriental scholars
of the West—particularly Charles Philip Brown, who published
in 1829 a collection of Vemana Padyamulu with an English translation
by him.    In 1892 about 100 select verses of Vemana were edited
ill Tamil character ivith Tamil paraphrase by one Sitarama
Prasad.   The Telugii text in Tamil letters edited on the basis of
C. P. Brown’s edition, with Tamil prose translation by Puduvai
Narayanadasar, was published in 1903.            It is a storehouse of
universal wisdom, and of the poetic thoughts of the Indian mind,
some of which are peculiar to the culture of the Telugus.
  The period of time to which Vemana belonged is a matter of
speculation.   There are some scholars who arc inclined to assert
that he lived in the 15th century, but from the language used by
Vemana I think he cannot be a poet of such an early age.           He
probably belongs to the 16th century.
                          CHAPTER IV

            Southern School^ of Telugu Literature
 During       this period Tclugu literature flourished in Southern
   India at Tanjore and Madhura under the patronage of Nayak
   Kings, and at Pudukkota and Mysore under the patronage of the
   local rulers. Among the features pecifliar to the Southern school
   of Telugu literature, the following deserve special notice: we find
   a comparatively larger number of poets among kings and women
   than in the main Telugu country; the popular desi metre, parti¬
   cularly dvipada was more extensively used; prose literature in
  simple Telugu with the dialectal forms of the spoken tongue of
  these regions received the recognition of the pandits and patrons
  of the Southern School. Music made very good progress and
  ragas were classified for the first time under the seventy-two
  melakartas.    The composition of songs was patronised, and
  recognised to be of the same status as that of the kavyas. The
  erotic sentiment was a special feature of the songs and poems
  composed. Patrons encouraged it, poets revelled in it, and people
 in general developed a fancy for it. Even vulgar sentiments were
  tolerated because they were clothed in charming language, with
 amusing modes of stylistic ornament. Today, purists, genuine as
 well as affected, condemn this trend. Persons with literary taste
 tolerate it, while those given to levity and philandering favour the
 erotic sentiment with which some poems of the Southern School
 are saturated. Books of knowledge relating to several sciences*
 arts and crafts also formed part of the Telugu literature of this
 region. Biographies known as myakabhyudayas were composed
 at Tanjore and Madhura.
    More than anything else, we have to note the Takshagana plays
for which the Southern School of Telugu literature has become
justly famous.
    Dtuing the time of Achyutadevaraya (1530—1542), successor
of Krishnadevaraya, two poets rose to prominence in the South;
(1) Bhadrakavi Lingakavi composed in desi dmpada metre*
Dioanga pwrarumiy the ancient history of the Devangas—^weavers.
It narrates the story of Manumahaz^i who was bom as the son
                                   39
 40                                HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

 of Isvara and had several incarnations. (2) Pachchakappurapu
 Tiruvengala Kavi of the caste of Bhatrajas—known for their
 extempore outburst of verses in praise of patrons and rich people
 from whom they expect rewards—composed Chokkanaiha Charitra
 in dvipada metre and dedicated it to Golla Pedda Ramanayaka
 governor of Ramnad District in tlie South. This is a collection
 of 64 tales relating to the miracles and pranks of Chokkanatha-
 swami, an incarnation of Siva, composed in easy flowing style.
 Dr. Nelaturu Venkataramanayya says that the court of Achyuta-
 devaraya was the first plate where the Southern School in Telugu
 literature had its prominent start. A rapid survey of the Literature
 that developed in the South will be presented under the main
 centres of its development.

   Tanjore
     The brightest period of Telugu literature in the South was
  during the time of Raghimatha Nayak (1600—1631) and of his
   third son Vijaya Raghava Nayak (1633—1673).
     Raghimatha Nayak and his court-poets remind us of Krishna-
  devaraya and his court-poets, through their production of high
  class literature and by setting models which were followed by
  later poets. In some respects the period of Raghunatha Nayak
  presents new features and developments. There appeared
  poetesses of considerable merit, of whom Ramabhadramba
  possessed sound scholarship in Sanskrit and Telugu. Her composi¬
  tions in Telugu have been lost but her Raghunathabhyudayam, a
  poem in Sanskrit in 12 cantos and 900 slokas, is preserved; it
  describes the ancestry of Raghunatha and extols his exploits, his
  scholarship and his patronage of art and literature. It also throws
  considerable light on the education and cultural attainments of
 ■the women of the period and on the progress of music, dance and
 drama. Madhuravani exhibits still greater scholarship and
 poetical talents. While her Telugu works like Ramabhadramba’s
Tiave disappeared, her Ramayana in Sanskrit up to Sundara Kanda
 is available to posterity. From one of the colophons in this work
 we learn that she was honoured by the king and the pandits of his
court as a great poetess in Sanskrit, Prakrit and Telugu, and that
 she had the special honour of being bathed in gold by Raghunatha
 Nayak.
> Raghunatha Nayak himself was a prolific writer. He composed
 SOUTHERN SCHOOL OP TELUOU LITERATURE                               41
  in dvipada metre, his father’s biography known as Achyutabhjmdayam.
   He thus set the model for writing biographies which was copied
   by his son and grandson. Raghunatha’s Nala Chariira in dvipada
    metre is considered to be one of the best dvipada poems in Telugu
   literature. Some difficult verses in Srinatha’s Sringara Pfaishadham
   are recast in simple Telugu mth proverbs and popular expressions.
   Some extracts deserve to be translated into Hindi. His Ramayanam
  did not proceed beyond Balakanda, though it is clear that he had
  •planned his poem on the same scale as Valmiki Ramayanam,
   Some scholars thought that Madh^ratani translated at his request
  Jiis Ramayana into Sanskrit, but a close comparison of the two
   works does not lend any support to that impression. Ragunatha’s
   Valmiki Charitra is a short poem in three cantos. It exhibits the
  poetical talents of the author. It is composed in easy, charming
  style, with delightful description.
      Chemakura Venkata Kavi is the best poet of this age. His
   Vijaya Vilasam is regarded by some scholars as worthy of a place
 Among the panchamahakavyas of Telugu literature. Moreover
  one point is very interesting: Vijaya Vilasam was composed probably
  about 1630 and Sarangadhara Charitra w'as his earlier production.
  For Appakavi to quote from them, they must have been regarded
  as brilliant. Evidently, they gained popularity in a very short
  time. The episodes are narrated in simple, idiomatic and
  melodious language. Some of the verses arc frequently recited
  even today by lovers of poetry in the Telugu coimtry,
      Krishnadhvari (1600—31) was also a prolific writer and a
  great scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu. He composed, in Sanskrit,
 Raghmatha Bhupaliyam on the model of Vidyanatha’s Prataparudriyamy
  a work on poetics and rhetoric. Offiis works in Telugu we have
  his Pfaisheuihaparijatiyami a dvyarthi kavya which narrates both the
 stories of Nala and Parijatapaharanam with the same set of verses.
 We have with this, three dvyarthi kavyaSy Raghava Pandaviyaniy
 Harischandra Nalopakhyandmy and Naishadha Pmijatam. Some
 scholars are of the opinion that the last is the best, with regard to
  the development of the stories and the descriptions of men and of
 nature in ah appropriate, dignified and yet easy language.
 . Kshetrayya of the coastal district Krishna and Kayi Ghoudappa
■n Sataka poet of Madhura paid visits to the court of Raghunatha
And were honoured. As they do not belong to Tanjore, I shall
 •refer to their compositions elsewhere.
  42                                HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE^

     Chengalva Kalakavi (1633—73) author of Rqjagopala VUasam
  had his earlier career in the court of Raghunatha Nayak and the
  later, and the more brilliant one, during the time of Vijaya Raghava
  Nayak. His poem relates to the amours of Krishna whose eight
  consorts were therein characterised as the eight types of nayikas
  as detailed below;
     Rukmini as Sviya; Bhadra as Kalahantarita; Lakshana as
  Vasavasajjika; Jambavati as Vipralabdka; Mitravinda as Khandita;
  Sudanta as Virahotkanthita; Kalindi as Proshita bhartrka; and Satya-
  bhama as Svadhinapatika. Thci poem is in five cantos containing
  in all 454 verses. Mannargudi in Tanjore district was described
  as Dakshina Dvaraka rivalling the real Dvaraka in Northern India
  in holiness, natural beauty and comfort. The deity to whom
  Mannargudi was consecrated was regarded as the same as Lord
  Krishna. In style, language and dignified run of verse, in poetic
  conceits, sentiments and emotions, Kalakavi, also known as,
  Kalayya, is regarded by some scholars as an equal to Nannaya
  and Srinatha, though others like Dr. N. Venkataramanayya do-
 not agree. All are agreed that he has a high place in Telugu
 literature. This poem was composed in 1633, the very first year-
 of Vijaya Raghava Nayak’s accession to the throne.
    Koneti Dikshita Chandra is the author of Vijaya Raghava K(Uyanam,.
 the marriage of Vijaya Raghava with Kantimati. This was-
 composed (about 1680) as a yakshagana, a dance-drama with
 verses, songs, rhythmic prose passages and dialogues in popular
 language. It is a good example of what is known as madhurabhakti.
    I have no place to refer to some other poets who composed
yakshaganas. But I must mention Pasupuleti Rangajamma
popularly known as Rangaji. By virtue of her learning, poetical
talents, ready wit and humour, and ability to compose vorse in.
eight langu^es, she had the rare privilege of being bathed in gold,
by her royal patron, Vijaya Raghava. Among the works composed
by her are two prabandhas viz. Mannarudasa VUasam and Usha*-
parinqyam; one song-drama of the yakshagana type known as-
Manmmtdasa VUasam and three abridged stories in prose relating:
to the Ramayanam) and Bharatam and the Bha^avatam. Of these,
Mantutrudasa VUasam^ a song drama, ctmtains verses in ei^t lai^-
ages, viz., Sanskrit, Prakrit, Sauraseni, Magadhi, Paisachi, Ghulika^
Apabhramsa in addition to Telugu in which the main work was-
composed. The story relates to the marriage of Vijayara^avR
 SOUTHERN SCHOOL OF TELUOU LITERATURE                              43
  with Kantiznati. She could create situations that naturally fitted
  into the story and afforded opportunities to display her knowledge
  of several scientific subjects^ and her keen insight into the social
  customs and manners of her time. She also provided ample
  scope for comical dialogues scintillating with wit and humour.
     Ushaparinayam was composed as a prabandha and we have a
  single manuscript copy of it in the Sarasvati Mahal Oriental
  Manuscripts Library at Tanjorc. It contains only three complete
  cantos and a part of the fourth. It is no doubt an interesting
  poem but cannot stand comparison ^vith poems relating to the
  same theme composed by Kanuparti Abbayamatya and others.
     The poem, Mannarudasa Vilasam composed in the prabandha
 style relates to the deityof Mannaru, Vijayaraghava’s devotion and
  donations to the temple and his marriage with Kantimati. It is
 of ordinary merit.
    Rangajamma’s stray verses in response to the jealous queen’s
 messages are very interesting.
    Vijayaraghava Nayak (1633—73) was, like his father, not only
 a patron of literature but also a great scholar and poet. He
 composed, besides his father’s biography, two more dvipada kavyaSy
 viz., Mohini Vilasam and Padukasahasramy several songs including
 Gopikagitas and Bhramara gitas—translations of the originals in
 Sanskrit—and more than twenty song>dr£unas of the yaksKagam
 type.
    Tanjore was conquered by the Maharattas and their rule
 extended from 1674 to 1855. They patronised Sanskrit literature
and to some extent Telugu literature also. Of these kings, Sahaji
 Maharaj (1684—1712) son of Ekoji I, the founder of the dynasty
 of Maharashtra rulers at Tanjore and grandson of the famous
 Sivaji, was a great patron of letters. He was well-versed in Sanskrit
and Telugu besides his mother tongue. He was a prolific writer
with about twenty works to his credit. Almost all of them are
either dance-dramas or of the type of operas—the later developed
typws of Tanjore yakslmganas. Of these, works with themes
relating to Siva, like Kirata Vilasamy Ganga Parvati Samvadam,
Satdeara Pallakisiva Prabandkam were dedicated to Siva; works with
themes relating to Krishna such as Krishnalilmtilasamy Jalakrida^
and Rukmini Satyabhama Sanwadam were dedicated to Krishna and
Sivakalyanam to Rama. His Tyagaraja Vinoda Charitra belongs to a
peculiar type of literature; it is partly a prabandha and partly a
 •44                              HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

-drama; and it contains sentences representing Sanskrit, Maha¬
rashtra and Telugu languages.
   Tukkoji (Tulakaji) who ruled from 1728 to 1736 was a poet
and patron of letters. He wrote a dance-drama known as Sivakama
Sundari Parinayam.
   Ekoji II (1737) composed iRamayana in dvipada metre and
some didactic verses. He was also the author of Vighnesvara
Kalyanarrii with Sanskrit as well as Telugu sentences.
  Muddu Palani was a poetess patronised by Pratapasimha,
Maharashtra ruler of Tapjorc. She composed in about 1740,
Radhikasantvanam a very popular and charming poem in four
cantos. Erotic sentiment runs through the poem. It is no doubt
vulgar in some places, but the vulgarity is astutely screened by
melodious and polite expressions.

 Madhura (1529—1736)
   The development of prose literature along with poetry is the
 special feature of the Telugu literature that developed under the
 patronage of the Madhura Nayak rulers. Rayavachakam was
 written by Sthanapati (a local representative of Madhura at the
‘Vijayanagara court) during the time of Visvanatha Nayak
 (1529—64). It deserves notice because it contains valuable
-material of historical importance regarding the rise and growth of
Vijayanagar Empire and the exploits of Krishnadevaraya. It is
‘written in beautiful language and may be regarded as a typical
specimen of prose literature in the earlier stage.
   Literature worth mentioning had its commencement during the
time of Tirumala Nayak (1623—29). Sri Kameswara Kavi
 (1623—1670) was a poet and musician who could play well on
the Vina. He composed a poem Salyahhama Sanlvanam^ the first
of a series of Telugu poems of the type of santvana kavyas that
developed here with the erotic sentiment running through them.
Krishna is depicted here not as the political hero of the Maha-
bharata or as Lord Krishna of the Bhagavata, but as Gopika»
mllahha and Satyabhamavidheya. The poem affords no doubt
great delight to the reader unless he be an extraordinary purist.
Dhenu Mahatmyam is a prose work of this poet.
   Ganapavarapu Venkata Kavi who was patronised by Muddala-
giri, grandson of Tirumala Nayak (1674)^ composed a dandaka
poem known as Vidyavati t)andakam relating to the amours of a
 SOUTHERN SCHOOL OF TELUOU LITERATURE                                45

   damsel and Muddalagiri, his patron. It illustrates a special type
  of poetic composition. Dandaka is a metre that requires feet of
  three syllables (long, long and short) except in the beginning
  where few short syllables may optionally appear. There is no
  limit to the length of this metrical composition. Malikas by which
  is meant vrittams containing rtbt the usual number of four but any
  numbei of lines beyond four were also composed. But the more
  important work of this poet is a poem known as Prabandharaja
  Venkteswara Vijayam which displays his profound scholarship and
 his extraordinary command of Sjinskrit and Telugu. He was
 capable of performing all sorts of acrobatic feats in literary composi¬
 tion. His verses run smooth with alliteration, rhyming words
 and various modes of stylistic ornaments. AVe may admire him
 for his extraordinary scholarship but cannot say that there is much
 poetry in his poems. His Andhra Kaumudi is a treatise on Telugu
 grammar, all in verse of only one variety of Telugu metres known
 as sisas. It runs smooth and the language is easy but we cannot
 call it poetry. It was composed in those days when students were
 encouraged to memorise grammar and any other branch of
 knowledge worth studying. This Venkata Kavi was, however,
 a prodigious wTiter.
    Vijayaranga Chokkanatha (1706—32) was of the type of
 Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagar and Vijayaraghava Nayak of
 Tanjore in patronising poets and encouraging Telugu literature
 besides being a poet and writer himself. He wrote Magkama-
 hatmyam and Srirangamahatmyam in spoken Telugu. Samukham
 Venkata Krishnappa Nayak, Sesham Venkatapati, Kundurti
Venkatachalapati, Velagapudi Krishnayya, Baddepudi Erra
 Nripala and Tirumala flourished as his court poets and there-
 might be some more poets not known to us. The king’s minister,
 Vangala Sinayya, was the author of Ramanuja Charitra.
    Samukham Venkata Krishnappa (1704—31) was the author of
Jaimini Bharatam and Sarangadhara Charitra in prose, and of Akalya
Sankrandanam composed as a poem in varying metres. This poem
is full of erotic sentiment. His Jaimini Bharatam is for the most
part a pro^ version of Pillamarri Pina Virabhadra’s poem, and
his Sarangadhara Charitra is based on Chemakura Venkatakavi’s
poem. The adoption of the popular dialects in the prose versions
of previous poems was a notable feature at Madhura.
    Velagapudi Krishnayya (1704—31) was a prolific writer but
 46                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

 only two of his compositions have been preserved,•though not yet
 printed. One is a prahandha of five cantos known as Bhanumad
  Vijayam. It relates to the story of a Brahman youth, Bhanumanta,
 who married Padmavati, a princess of Ujjayini. It contains
sweet and pleasant thoughts expressed in melodious verses with
appropriate figures of speech; the'fifth canto contains a good
exposition of the Yoga sastra of Patanjali. It is intended to
 propagate the Saiva creed. The other is Gaulikasastram, a scientific
 treatise on the lizard.
    Kundurti Venkatachala rK^vi (1704—32) was also a prolific
 writer, an adept in extemporaneous narration of stories and an
author of many yakshaganas and prose works, but none of them
has come to light. Only two poems of his have been preserved;
one of them is a prabandha in six cantos, known as Miiravinda-
parinayam relating to the marriage of Krishna with Mitravinda.
 It contains all the features of the prabandha type of literature, and
exhibits a high class poetic and creative art. It has melodious
verses with pleasing thoughts, but cannot come up to the level of
Manucharitra or Prabhavatipradyumnam. The other is also a
prabandha^ known as Kartikamahatmyamt inferior to Mitravinda
Parinayam in poetic merit.

Pudukkotta (1682—1839)
   Pudukkotta was never a part of the kingdom of the Telugu
Nayaks, and the rulers of Pudukkotta have always been Tamils,
either by race or by language, but it is an agreeable surprise to
find that they patronised Telugu literature, and some of them
were poets in Telugu. Of these rulers, Vijaya Raghunatha
Tondaman who reigned from 1730—1769, was a famous patron
of Telugu poets. Raya Raghunatha Tondaman, who succeeded
his father in 1769 and reigned till 1789, was not only a patron of
Telugu literature but was also a famous poet. In spite of his
supreme position as king and scholar, he showed considerable
humility in the presence of pandits, and he expressed his devotion
to his guru Nudurupati Uddanda Kavi Sitaramarya. Raya
Raghunatha’s Parvatiparinayam is considered to be a poem of high
poetic conceits; it contains original descriptions and exhibits a
high sense of propriety and decorum.
   Uddanda Kavi Sitaramarya’s son, Venkanarya, was also an
•equally famous scholar and poet, and he was also awarded the
SOUTHERN SCHOOL OF TELUOU LITERATURE                                47
  title of Uddandakavu He flourished at the court of Raghunatha
  Raya Tondaman and was a prolific writer. His Andhra Bhashoa*
  imam is a lexicon in verse. It follows the method of Amarakosa in
  Sanskrit classifying the Telugu words, and includes the dialectal
  variations and words current in different parts of the Telugu
  country. His Ragkunathiyam is an alankara sastra (poetics) similar
  to Prataparudriyam in Sanskrit and Narasabhupaliyam by Ramaraja-
  bhushana in Telugu. His Tondaman Vamsavali is a historical
  narrative describing the valour of the Tondaman rulers of
  Pudukkotta. His Brihannayika dandakamis a lengthy verse in dandaka
  metre; it relates the heroic exploits of Raghunatha and his con¬
 sort. His Mallupuranam relates to the story of Devamalla. Of all his
 works, Andhra Bhasharnavam is the only one that has been printed.
     This king is also the author of Kavijanojjivani which contains one
 hundred verses, in each of which the fourth line is of the type of a
 quiz—a riddle or a puzzle, intended to test the ingenuity of a poet,
-and the first three lines contain the solution. The fourth line,
 which is by itself nonsensical, acquires sense when read together
 with the first three lines. Poets sometimes indulge in such poetic
■contests. One gives the fourth line and asks his rival to compose
 the first three lines with which the fourth line can be intelligibly
harmonised.
    Raya Raghunatha’s successors also were patrons of Telugu
poets. Gonasuru Narayan^uru wrote in Telugu verse Rasanunyarif
a translation of the original of the same name in Sanskrit by Bhanu
 Misra. The author says that he wrote it at the request of his
 patron, Vijaya Raghimatha who succeeded his fatho* Raya-
raghunatha in 1789.

Mysore
    Telugu literature flourished also at Mysore under the patronage
of the rulers of that State particularly during the time of
Chikadevaraya (1672—1704). Yakshaganas of the type of koravanji
developed here.
   Peda Kempa Gauda who was famous for the construction of
Bangalore ifl 1537, ruled the region then known as Sivasamudra
from 1513 to 1569 and was honoured by the contemporary rulers
of Vijayanagara—Krishnadevaraya and Achyutadevaraya. He
composed ayakshagana known as Ganga Gouri Vilasam and dedicated
it to Lord Somesvara.
48                                  HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

    Kaluva Viraraju who flourished during 1680—1750 composed
 the Mahahharatam in prose in about 1730. From the introductory
 verses in his prose Bharatam, it is evident that he composed Telugu
 poetry also. His prose is in poetic diction.
    Nanjaraju, son of Viraraju, excelled his father as a writer. Ho
 wielded great influence as a powerful administrator, and, by
 virtue of his position and fortune, became not only a wiiter but
 also a patron of poets. He wrote in prose, Halasya Mahatmyam
 relating to the amours of Minakshiand Sundareswara at Madhura,
 and Kasimahima darpanam, relating to the greatness of Kasi.
    Koduri Venkatachala Kavi wi'ote Sivarahasya Khandam and
 dedicated it to Muluvagalu Bhupati a local chief of the Bellary
region (1650—1700). It exhibits great poetical talent on tho
 part of the author, and his love of ornate language with poetic
 flashes at several places. He bore the title of Bala Sarasvati.
    There are several other poets outside the main Telugu country
for whom I can find no place in this short account.
    Before I proceed to the next period of Telugu literature, I should
like to say a few words about some poets whom I left out in the
previous part of my survey because they deserve special mention.
    Kummari Molla—earliest poetess of Telugu literature was the
daughter of Atukuri Kesaya, a potter. She comppsed in the
abridged form the Ramayana in six cantos of verse interspersed
with prose. It is noted for its felicity of narrative skill, and power
of description with appropriate figures of speech. But there is a.
dispute among scholars about her date. If, as some think, she
was a contemporary of Tikkana of the 13th century, she is decidedly
the earliest poetess of Telugu literature; but if, as some others
urge she lived after Krishnadevaraya, Mohanangi, daughter of
Krishnadevaraya and wife of Ramaraja—said to be the authoress
of a Telugu poem, Marichiparinayamu—must be the earlier of the
two. It is not, however, certain if Mohanangi ever existed because
there is no evidence to prove it, nor is any Marichiparinayam available
to us.
    Recently another poetess of the past was discovered—Tallapaka
Timmakka, wife of Annamacharya who composed,-in dvipada,
Subhadrarjmiyam. The poem has an attractive style and contains
very pleasing descriptions. Some of them, particularly those
relating to Arjuna, appear to have been copied by Chemakura
Venkata kavi and embodied in his Vijaya Vilasamy with slight
SOUTHERN SCHOOL OP TELUOU UTERATURE                               49

verbal alterations to suit the requirements of the metre he adopted.
Timmakka lived in the 15th century and may be r^arded as the
earliest Tclugu poetess, if Molla lived in the 16th century.
   Earliest poem in Pure Telugu: Ponnikanti Telaganna composed
 Tayati Charitra in * pure * Telugu by which is meant Telugu without
 any Sanskrit or Prakrit words. Previous to his time, there had
 appeared stray verses of this type in certain kavyas. He dedicated
his poem to Amin Khan, a rich official in the sovice of Malik
Ibrahim Kutub Shah, Sultan of Golconda (popularly called in
Tclugu Malk-Abhiram) who reigqed«from 1550—1581. Subse¬
quently many other poets like Kuchimanchi Timma Kavi composed
 poems in pure Telugu, but Tayaticharitra seems to be the best, for
it is in simple flowing style and comparatively easier to under¬
stand, while the others contain artificial manipulations of Sanskrit
words to make them appear as pure Telugu.
   Another point of interest in this poem is that the Sultans of
 Golconda and their officials were favourably disposed towards the
Tclugu language and people.           They patronised many Telugu
poets as detailed below.
   Some other poets of the age:
   Kandukuru Rudrayya is the author of Janardanashtakam (or eight
stanzas) outpouring of devotion, a lyrical poem addressed to the
Deity Janardana. His Sugrim Vijayam is a yakshagana composed
about 1568 in a dignified style with poetic diction. It relates to
the victory of Sugriva, the vanara chief and ally of Rama. Hia
Mirankusopakhyanam is a poon in mixed verse and prose, the theme
being a religious legend contrasting the results of piety and sin.
His lyrical song is regarded as the best of his wotIcs. Ibrahim
Kutub Shah recognised his merits and granted him the lands of a
village, Ghintalapalem.
   2. Malla Redd! (1560—1600) is spoken of in some stray verse?
current in the country as a poet patronised by Malik Ibrahim, the
Sultan of Golconda. He composed Padmapuraaemf Sioadhar*
mottarakhandam and Shatchakravarti Charitra of which the third is die*
best; it illustrates his noteworthy poetical talent.
   3. Addanki Gangadhara Kavi is the author of a well-kil#$lm
Telugu prabandhat Tapati-Samsofanopakhyanam describing the love
of Samvarana for Tapati, the younger sister of Savitri, as narrated
in the Aranya parva of the Mahabharata, It was dedicated in 1565
to Ibrahim Kutub Shah who had honoured him as his court poet.
     4
 50                                 HISTORY OF TELUOC7 LITERATURE

    4. Matla Ananta Bhupala, ruler of a small principality, composed
 in about 1580 Kakutstha Vijayam as a prabandha and dedicated it
 to his father when he was still a Yuvaraj. Both father and son
 appear to have been contemporaries and friends of Ibrahim Kutub
 Shah. This poem is spoken of as an excellent piece of Telugu
 literature by virtue of its chaste language and melodious expression,
    5. Elakuchi Balasaraswati of about 1600—1640 was a genius,
 a profound scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu, a high-class poet, and
 as an authority on grammar he has been held in high esteem by
 pandits. He is known as^ Bhattara Balasaraswati kavi Maho-
 padhyaya. He dedicated his poem Chandrikaparinayam to Sarasvati
 as suggested by his patron Jupalli Venkatadri, a zamindar of
 Partiyala in Hyderabad territory near Vijayawada. This poem
 relates to the legend of Bhima who married Chandrika, daughter
 of Kasiraja. He composed another poem known as Mallahhupaliyay
 a Telugu adaptation of Bhartruhari Subhashitam in Sanskrit.
 His gigantic feat in literary composition is a tryarthikavyam known
as Raghava Tadava Pandaviyam which presents with the same set of
verses three stories viz., the Ramayana, the Bhs^avata and the
Bharata. He wrote a comprehensive commentary known as
Balasarasvatiyam on Andhra Sabda Chintamani, a Telugu grammar
in Sanskrit language attributed by pandits to Nannayabhat.
Appakavi who composed in 1656—60 his book in verse on prosody
and grammar, .popularly known as Appakaviyaniy lived a few years
after Balasarasvati. Appakavi narrates that he had a dream in
which Lord Krishna appeared and bade him compose a treatise,
in verse with the material of Balasarasvatiyam; that a copy of
Sabdachintamani had been presented to Balasarasvati by a siddha,
a copy prepared from memory by Sarangadhara, because the
original was thrown away into the waters of the Godavari by
Bhimakavi out of spite and jealousy.
    Vaggeyakaras and Song composers:—
  . No mention was made cither of Kshetrayya or Tyagaraja in
Viresalingam’s Lives of Telugu Poets or in similar works till
recently, because the interest of scholars was centred in kavya
literature, and also because songs did not rigidly follow the rules
of grammar. Nor were the scholars very particular about
yakshaganas or sataka literature, in which also the spoken forms
were freely used. Modem scholars, however, recognise the poetic
.^d literary merit of the songs, of Kshj^trayya, Tyagaraja
SOUTHERN SCHOOL OF TELUOU LITERATURE                             51

■and other composers and of tJie yakshaganas and satakas.
    Kshetrayya was contemporaneous with Vijayaraghava Nayak
of Tanjore in whose name he composed some songs and sang
l)efore him. He was born and brought up in Muwa or Movva,
a village in Krishna District and toured extensively. He is said
 to have composed about 4,000 songs but we have not been able to
■collect more than four hundred. His compositions are famous
 for their musical and literary merit, and for their adaptability
 to dance and abkinaya. It is a pity that the music notation was
 not recorded, though the name jaf ragam as ^vell as talam was
 noted. Each song is devoted to a particular type of nayika
 mentioned in Bharata Natya Sastra. Kshetrayya used very appro¬
 priate and melodious expressions and selected ragas and talas so
 dexterously that, when the songs are sung the charm of the music
 sustains the sentiment expressed. Scholars arc of the opinion
 that, so far as the literary quality is concerned, they are superior
 to Tyagaraja’s songs though the musical aspect is richer in the
latter.
    Tyagaraja belongs to the middle of the 18th century. It is
tiaid that he had learnt to sing Kshetrayyas’s songs, and Purandara
 Dasa’s songs in Kannada, before he composed his own songs.
 Tradition says that he visited Bhadrachalam and came to know
 of the story of Gopanna (known as Ramadas in the country) and
 was acquainted with the songs composed by him—songs full of
 devotion to Rama, and Gopanna’s Satakam, known as Dasarathi
 Satakam also. In the fervour of bhakti (devotional sentiment)—
 and in the excellence of their music Tyagaraja’s songs are the best.
 Tyagaraja is worshipped as a saint, and his songs are sung all over
 ’Southern India by Tamils, Malayalis and Kannadigas as well as
 the Telugus. The Tamils are proud of him, because he was born
 and brought up on the banks of the Kaveri, and the Telugus are
 proud on account of the language (Telugu) in which they were
■composed.
    Tupakula Ananta Bhupala, a ruler of the fort of Jingi (Chenji)
■in South Arcot district (about 1730) was a well-known scholar,
 patron of ffteraturc and an eminent writer. He wrote in prose
  Vishnupuranarriy Bhagavadgita, and the Sundarakanda of the
 Ramayanam. The first two arc printed but the third is still in
 the manuscript stage. Hia style is melodious and dignified.
                            CHAPTER V

                        Later Prabandhas
                                       «
 Decadence     in thought started with the conquest of the Deccan,
 by the Moghuls and the spread of the scare caused by the
 Mohammedan invasions of the Tclugu country and the consequent
 disappearance of sources of patronage for art and literature. A
 kind of despair drove people from self-reliance to reliance on
 deities.   The lack of intellectual vigour and the poverty of literary
 skill naturally led to pathetic expressions of helplessness and
 pitiful prayers to gods. P. T. Kaju cites in his ‘ Telugu Literature ’
 (P.E.N. series) three typical satakas as indicating this as abject
 condition of the Telugu people: Bhadradrirama Satakaniy Andhra
Nayaka Satakam and Simhadrinarasimha Satakam. When the
 Mohammedans plundered the country and threatened to destroy
the Hindu temples, the idols of Rama, Sita and Lakslunema were
removed from the temple of Bhadrachalam to Polavaram lest they
should be defiled by the invaders. In such miserable circum¬
stances, Narasimha Kavi (about 1750) poured forth, in a devotional
frenzy, 101 verses in adoration of the divine hero Rama, each
verse addressed to Bhadradri Rama, and it is said that the Lofd
listened to His devotee’s prayers and the danger was averted*
Later on, the images were taken back to Bhadrachalam and
re*consecretaed in the temple. When the worship of Andhra
Vishnu or Andhra Nayaka in the temple at Srikakulam near
Vijayawada was neglected and the place was deserted for fear of
Mohammedan invasions and raids, Kasula Purushottamudu
(1798) composed his Andhra J^qyaka Satakam, The local zamindar
was so deeply moved by a recital of the poem that he repaired the
temple and restored the worship. Each verse in this sataka of
108 verses ends in an address to Srikakulandhra Deva. The
story connected with Simhadrinarasimha Satakam is marvellous;
when the Mohammedans threatened the destruction of the temple
at Simhachalam near Visakhapatnam, a devotee, Gokulapati
Kurmanatha Kavi (1725) stood before the deity Narasimha pcased
on one leg and poured forth verse after verse in an emotional out¬
burst reproving the Deity’s apathy and stirri^ Him to action*.
                                  52
   1«ATER PRABANDHAS                                                 53
     In verse 57, he says, for example, ‘ villages arc deserted, carops
    are destroyed, men are' cruelly molested and robbed and left with
     nothing but their loin cloth, people run scattered... there! there!
     the Mohammadan marauders are approaching this temple.
     Save Thyself and Thy devotees **. The traditional story connected
    with this incident relates that when the sixty-seventh verse was
    poured forth, a huge swarm of bees rushed out of the temple,
    attacked the marauders, and drove them away. The poet was
    immensely pleased and in the next versc,^hc says ‘ O! Lord! we had
    only heard of your exploits and of fhe destruction of the wicked,
    but now we arc able to sec with our eyes your mighty and mysterious
   ways of destroying the wicked and protecting the people *. The
   remaining thirty three verses were sung in praise of the glory of the
   deity. Whatever be the truth of this incident, it can be said that
   people believed and still believe that God would listen to the
   sincere prayers of the devotees. This poet wrote some more
   satakams and poems. His songs relating to Lakshminarayana
  Samvadam are still sung at the temples of Simhachalam, and
  Padmanabham in Visakhapatnam district, and at Srikurmam in
  Srikakulam district.
      Adidam Sura Kavi (1720—85) of Visakhapatnam or East-
  Godavari district, belongs to this period of despair, but it is said
  that the spirit of self-reliance never deserted him, and he could
 always stand up against adversity. He was a prolific writer, a
 great scholar, a poet capable of extempore composition. By that
 time, the rulers of large kingdoms had vanished, but there were
 petty chiefs paying tribute to the Nizam and wielding power in
 their localities. Some of them were patrons of literature and
 Sura Kavi, therefore, approached all of them. Everywhere he
 commanded the respect of wealthy landlords and chieftains and
carried on his literary work with their patronage. His Ramalingesa
Satakam is a satire intended to expose the wicked ways of men in
 power and the morbid condition of social life in his time. There
are traditional stories current in the country which narrate how
when a chief prevented the water in the local tank from flowing
into Sura Kavi’s fields, Surana recited six verses extempore,
commanding the water in the tank to flow out breaking the tank
bund and as soon as the last verse was recited the bund gave way
and water flowed out to irrigate the poet’s fields. People have
wch feith in the powen of a devoted poet that they repeat the
54                                  HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

Story along with the verses, and these verses have wide currency
in the Telugu country. Sura Kavi wrote'a treatiife on grammar
and another on poetics and figures of speech, and also a short
lexicon as an appendix to Paidipati Lakshmana mantri’s Andhra
namasangraha in verse. His poem. ^ Kavijanaranjanam, also known
as Chandramaiiparinayam relates to the love of Harischandra and
Chandramati and their heroic fight against an adverse fate. His^
poetry is known for its easy vigour of expression and strong emotion.
    Kuchimanchi Timmakavi (1690—1757) lived in more favourable
circumstances than Adidam Sura Kavi, because the members of
his family were the village accountants and he had also the
 patronage of the Zamindars of the Pithapuram estate in East
 Godavari. He was a prolific writer with considerable scholarship
in Sanskrit and Telugu. Like several other poets, he started his
 poetic career w'ith satakas; in his 25th year he composed his first
 poem Rukminikalywiam, which exhibits his youthful romanticism.
 Later, he tvrote some more kavyas, viz., Rajasekhara Vilasam (also
 known as Bhallana Charitra), Simhachala Mahatmyam^ Nilasundari~
parinayam, Rasikajanamanobhiramamy Sarpapura Mahatmyam and
 Sivalila Vilasam and a work on grammar in verse, known as
 Sarvalakshanasarasangraham. Of these, J^ilasundariparinayam, a. poem
 of three cantos, w'as composed in ‘ pure ’ Telugu. It deals with
 the legend of Krishna’s union with Nila. It may seem odd, but
 it is nevertheless true, that the ordinary Telugus cannot understand
 ‘ pure ’ Telugu, for they have in course of time replaced in their
 speech many Telugu words by their Sanskrit equivalents. More¬
 over, the so-called ‘ pure ’ Telugu of the poems is an artificial
 coinage, not the genuine Telugu of actual life. Some poets are
 eager to display this type of scholarship in their poems. Mlasundari'-
 parinayam^ however, has more of genuine Telugu and is, therefore,
 read with ease. It exhibits greater poetic art than Tcyatkharitra
  by Telaganna. Rajasekhara Vilasam relates the story of a prince
  whose devotion to Siva and love of truth were remarkable-
  Rasikajanamanobhiramam is a lengthy romantic poem in six cantos,
  describing the adventures of a prince and his love for a Gandharva
  damsel. It was composed in 1750 when the poet was about
  60 years old. There was ample scope for the poet’s ripe experience
  to be reflected in it. The erotic sentiment was also tempered
  with a cultivated sense of decorum. It was so well appreciated
  that he earned the title of Sarasakavi, *lSarpapura Mahatmyam
LATER PRABANDHAS                                                  5^
relates to the legend of a local Vaishnava cult near PithapuramJ
Sivalila Vilasam was the last of his works. He had become art
ardent devotee of Siva by that time, but his devotion to Siva was
never in conflict with his devotion to Vishnu. He was, by
intellectual conviction, an advaiti, and, in actual life, a devotee of
Vishnu and Siva with the firm belief that both of them were after
all one and the same.
   Ravu Madhava Mahipati, Rajah of Pithapuram, after reading
Timmakavi’s Riikminiparinayam and Rajasekhara Vilasam^ was
favourably impressed with his pottic&l talents and honoured him
by conferring on him the title, Kavisarvahhauma. He also requested
him to dedicate a poem to him, but Timmakavi, like Potana*
refused to comply with his request and dedicated all his works to
Lord Kukkutesvara. But, as a token of gratitude to the Rajah,,
he dedicated his Sarpapura Mahatmyam to Bhavanarayana swamy,
a Vaishnava deity at Sarpavaram worshipped by the Rajas of
Pithapuram. The Raja respected the poet’s sentiment and felt
happy that the poem was dedicated to his family Deity.
   His Sarvalakshanasarasangraham reveals that he had a liberal
outlook with regard to language andjgrammar. He cited examples
from literature, and improved upon the previous grammars by a
revision of the defective rules of grammar. His survey was based
on sound lines, but it is incomplete and imperfect. Adidam
 Surana also worked on similar lines and his Kavisamsaya Vichchhedant
cited many examples from the works of the previous poets and
incorporated them in his treatise on grammar. Both the poets
recognised the principle that grammatical rules should follow the
 usage in the country, evidenced in the works of men of letters.
   The Kuchimanchi family produced scholarly poets and Kuchi-
manchi Jaggakavi, the younger brother of Timmakavi, was also
a poet of eminence. His poem Subhadraparinayam and Somadeva-
rajiyam exhibit his poetic genius and fine sentiment, but his
Chandralekhavilapam is of the type of ‘ billings gate ’ literature.
Jaggakavi wrote it to wreak vengeance on a local magnate. ,
   There are many other poets who contributed to the growth of
Telugu literature even in this period of decadence in thought, but
their productions are of ordinary merit. Poets who had no
originality in thought or theme showed their skill in versification,
and acrobatic feats, composing verses using only one letter or two
betters, and poems without using the labial sounds in any verse;
 56                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE


  they indulged in intellectual gymnastics.        In such a period of
 decadence in thought, there flourished a few poets here and there
 like oases in a desert.
    One such oasis is Kankanti Paparaju, the author of Uttara
 Bnmayamm. The theme and its development exhibit the qualities
 of epic poetry, but the episodes illuslirate the prabandha style. His
friend and colleague was Pushpagiri Timmana, author of Samira
 Kumara Vijayam and of a translation of Bhartrhari’s Mtisatakam.
 The former refers to the exploits of Hanuman and is considered
 to be a poem of some merit; the hitter is not so good as the rendering
 of the same by Enugu Lakshmana Kavi.
    The erotic poetry that had developed in the Southern school of
 Telugu literature had its influence on the poets of the coastal
districts in this period of decadence. Bilhaniyam by Chitrakavi
Singanarya of about 1750, Radhakrishna Vilasam of Krishnadasa
of about 1760, Ahalya Sardcrandanam by Sangameswara of about
 1780, were composed in imitation of similar compositions at
Tanjore and Madurai.
    Sishtu Krishnamurti (1790—1870) was one of the greatest
 scholars and poets of this period. He was known to be an
extemporaneous poet and a very charming reader of the old
puranas, both Sanskrit and Telugu. His Sarvakamadaparinayam
was composed while he was at Ramachandrapuram in East
Godavari district. There is an interesting story connected with
 this poet. In the neighbourhood of Ramachandrapuram lived
 Pindiprolu Lakshmanakavi, already renowned as the author of a
dvyarlhi kavya, Ravanadammiyam or Lankadahanam. It narrates two
stories with the same verses—the well-known story of Ravana and
an account of Damma (Dharmayya), a rich man who disappointed
the poet in the matter of a reward promised to him and was,
therefore, ridiculed and depicted as a wicked fellow like Ravana.
It was with such a poet that Krishnamurti had an unfortunate
contest.
    Pindiprolu was much senior in age and more advanced in
poetic composition than Krishnamurti, who was, however, a great
scholar. There was rivalry between the two. One* day when
Krishnamurti was reading out his poem at a public gathering,
Pindiprolu mercilessly criticised one of his verses. As the people
had greater regard for the poetic art of Pindiprolu, they applauded
his criticism. Krishnamurti felt humiliated anckJeft Ramchandra*^

•down in a corner of Visakhapatanam district, continuing his
•career under the patronage of a local chief.   Such were the
chequered careers of some scholars and poets.

         Development of Different Types of Literature
                  other than Prabandha

     '                  Sataka Literature


By sataka (sata—one hundred) is meant a century of verses^
The development of satakas may be regarded as a special feature-
of Telugu Literature. There were, of course, satakas in Sanskrit,
Prakrit and a few other Indian Literatures like Kannada, but they
were very few and far between. Moreover, there is a significant
difference in the technique of composition between the sataka in
Telugu and the satakas in other literatures. There were, for
example, Bhakti Sataka, Sringara Sataka and Vairagya Sataka of
Bhartrhari in Sanskrit and each of them contained a hundred
slokas. Hala’s Saptasati in Prakrit contains as the name indicates,
seven hundred slokas. The slokas were of varying metres and
each sloka has an idea or theme which is complete in itself without
running into the succeding verse.
   But the satakas in Telugu have some special features. Each.
sataka has, of course, not fewer than one hundred verses to justify
the name, but it may have, and generally has, a few more verses..
If the number of verses reaches two hundred it is called dvisati.
 Venkata Saila Nay aka Dvisati by Mandapaka Parvatiswara Sastri.
of the 19th century is a famous example. There may also be-
trisatis or saptasatis, but everyone of the verses should have a common
word or words—generally a propemoun in the vocative case in
the last line, usually at the end of it—and a sataka is named after
the common word or words. In Bhavani Sattdeam the last word
of the fourth line of each verse is Bhavani as in,
  Velayaga na yedada tammi virini Bhavani\
  In Siva Satakam the last word of the fourth line of each verse is.
Siva! as in,
  giri—kanya ramanisa namu garmimpu Sival
   In Sarvesvara Satakam, the last compound word of the fourth
line of each verse is * Sarvesvara! as in,
   Srikara vasantamai mahimato jennondu Sarvesfktra!
s                                58
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LITERATURE                                            5^

  In Vrisha(Oiipa Satakam, the last four words of the fourth line of
each verse arc Basava! Basava! Basava! Vrishadhipa! as in,
     Vasigoni hrovumayya Basaval       Basaval    Basaval   Vrishadhipal
But the sataka is named after the last word.
    In some satakas like Vemana Satakam the fourth line Visvadabhirama
vimra Vernal ’ is generally the same.
   A peculiarity in the case of this sataka is noteworthy. The
author, Vemana, addresses himself unlike other poets, who address
a deity or their patron. Moreover, this sataka contains several
hundres of verses, though some are test to us and yet it is popularly,
known as a sataka. Kavi Choudappa Satakam is another sataka
where the author addresses himself.
    Sarabhalinga is another poet who would address himself in his
sataka known as Sarahhanka Sataka. The last word of the fourth
line is Sarahhanka Lingana! The last part of this compound
word is an affix which the Saivites arc fond of using at the end of
their names as Ramalinga, Rajalinga, Somalinga, Dharmalinga, etc.
    In the case of some satakas the name docs not represent the
exact word used in the sataka but is synonymous with it, as in
Hammachchalaka where the fourth line of the verse is Varthi langhana
samrambha vayu dimbha. Vayu dimbha means the Son of Wind>
indicating Hanuman.
    In some satakas, the principal word indicated by the name of
the sataka does not occur at the end of the fourth line, but appears
either at the beginning or somewhere else in the line, as in,
     Madana gopala! Radhika hridaya chora in Madanagopala sataka,.
dushta samhara Narasimhal durita dura in Narasimha sataka. But
 the text of the line should be the same for the last line of each verse*
     A sataka where the last part of the fourth line is tallini bolarevvarutt
 is known as Malru Sataka because matru is the Sanskrit equivalent
 of tain, the Telugu word for mother. The author bf this sataka
 is Matturi Appavu Modali, a Tamilian, who mastered the Telugu
 language. He violates the tradition of using a word in the vocative
 case. A recent poet, Narla Venkateswara Rao has likewise
 violated the tradition in his sataka Vasiavammu Xarlavari mata,.
 though he uses the same words for the fourth line of each vefsc.
     There are about nine hundred satakas in Telugu literature*
 With a few exceptions they have been addressed to the Deities,
 that can be grouped under Saivitc or Vaishnavitc. The Deities
 of the former are Siva, Paramasiva, Sadasiva, Balasasankamaulf
 «0                                 HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

   Chandrasekhara, Parvatesvara, Bhavanidhava, Bhai:ga, Parthiva*
   linga, Ramalinga, Bhimalinga, Panchamukhesvara^Agastyesvara,
    etc. The Deities known by the name of the place where Siva
   Became manifest and temples were consecrated to than, have
   Been also addressed as Kalahastilinga, Srikalahastisvara (at
   Kalahasti    near    Nellore),   Kasivisvanatha     (at  Varanasi)
   Kukkutesvara (at Pithapuram, East Godavari district) Sri Muha*
   lingesvara (at Mukhalingam in Srikakulam district). The
  ■consort of Siva was also addressed in some Satakas under the names
 ■of Ambika, Syamalamba, JlianaprasunambUca, Achanta Kamesvari
   (at Achanta in West Godavari district). Siva’s son Ganapati was
  also addressed in a few Satakas under the names of Ganapati and
  Vinayaka. The Vaishnava Deities that have been addressed in
  the Satakas may be grouped under classes (1) Vishnu in general
   (2) Nrisimha (3) Rama (4) Krishna. The Deities of class
  (1) are Kesava, Narayana, Jagadrakshaka; of class (2) Nrisimha,
 Narasimha and Nrikesari; of class (3) Rama, Ramachandra,
 Ramataraka, Ramaraksha, Raghava, Raghunayaka, Prasanna
 Raghava, Dasaratha Rama, Dasarathi, Janakipati, Sitapati etc.;
 of class (4) Krishna, Balakrishna, Gopalakrishna, Karivelpa
 (dark deity), Madana Gopala, Raja Gopala, Devakinandana,
 Vasudevanandana, Rukminipati etc.. The consort of Vishnu
 was also addressed in two Satakas as Lakshmi and Lakshmi devi.
 The deities known by the name of the place where they were
 manifest and temples were consecrated to them are Ontimetta
 Raghuvira (at Ontimetta in Kadappa District) and Bhadradri
 Rama (at Bhadrachalam in West Godavari District), Andhra
 Nayaka also known as Andhra Vishnu (at Srikakulam in Krishna
 District), Simhadri Narasimha, Simha Saila Nrisimha, Simhadri
 Ramadhipa (at Simhachalam in Visakhapatnam District,) Venkata-
saila Nayaka; Venkatachalapati (at Tirupati, Chittur Dbtrict),
Hamsaladivi Gopala (at Hamsaladivi, situated at the mouth
•of the Krishna).
     There are also Satakas in which the Goddess of Learning was
addressed as Sarasvati and Bharati.
     There are Satakas in which the planets also are addressed} viz.,
Surya, Suryanarayana, Bhaskara, Chhayaputra (Sani or Saturn).
     There are Satakas in which the mind or the soul is addressed
under the names of Chitta, Manasaf Paramatma, Sumati (one who
has a good mind), etc.                            ^
 PIFFERENT TYPES OF UTERATURE                                      6!
      In some Satakas the patrons of the poets are addressed out of
   respect—Jagannatha Yogi (God Jagannatha Rao ofVisakhapatnam
   after he became a yogi), Papaya mantri, Pemmayasingadhimani^
      The metres generally chosen for the Satakas arc Sardulaoikriditay
   Maitebhavikridita, Utpalamala and Champakamala among vrittams^
   Kanda (Corresponding to Arya in Sanskrit); among the Upajati
   metres and Tetagiti^ Ataveladi and Sisam among the dcsi metres in
  Telugu. The last words of each verse containing the name in
  the vocative case determine the type of the metre that is suitable
  to them. When the last word is, for example, Rama or Krishna
  or Sumati, the verses of the Sataka fire generally of kanda metre;
  when it is Sarvesvara or Srikalahastisvara, or Suryanarayana,
  the verses are either sardulavikridita or mattebhavUcridita; when
  it is Sasanka Sekhara or Sivadevadhimani or Venkatasailanayaka,
 the verses are either utpalamala or champakamala; when it is Raghava
 or Madhava or Bharati the verses may be any of the vrittas,
 mentioned above; when the last words arc Vayudimbha or Vinura.
 Verna they belong to either tetagiti or ataveladi and the exact metre
 is disclosed only when the whole line is known. “ Visvadabhirama
 vinura Verna or Vastavammu Narlavari mata is definitely ataveladi.
     Sarvesvara Satakam by Yathavakkula Annamayya seems to be
 first Sataka in Telugu literature. It was composed in 1242,
 according to the date mentioned in one of the verses of the Sataka;
 Sakabdambulu varthi shatka purabhit sankhyam (Saka 1164). Anna¬
 mayya was at first an inhabitant of the village near Rajahmundry
 known as Pattesa. He was brought up as an aradhya saivite-
 and Virabhadresvarasvami was his family Deity. In course
 of time, he went as a pilgrim to Srisaila to offer his prayers to-
 Sri Mallikarjuna. On his way back, he stayed for some days at
 a place known as Satrasala and in a hermitage renowned as-
Visvamitrasram on the banks of the river Krishna in Palnad»
That was a holy place because Siva manifested himself in the
name of Sri Mallikesvara, and Annamayya was wor^ipping the
Deity. During his stay he composed his Sarvesvara Satakam,
There is an interesting story connected with its composition. The
poet sat at tly edge of the river and, as he wrote each verse on a
separate palm leaf, he left it afioat on the waves of the river. If
it came back against the current, he would string it for record;
but if it passed on with the current he would clip it off with the
shears of destiny which he kept ready on his shoulders. The
€2                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

■Story says that many leaves came back and they ■were strung
 together, but the leaf containing the verse tarulam buvvulu pinde
iaf...did not return but was floating down the current, and
 when he noticed this he felt disconcerted, pulled out the shears
 and was about to clip off his head. Just at that moment, Siva
 himself appeared before him in the guise of a herdsman and gave
 him a palm leaf containing the verse Oka pushpambu bhavatpada
■dvayamu pai... in the place of the verse indicated above by the
 poet. There is, of course, considerable difference in thought
 between these two verses. Annamayya’s verse contained a
 mundane thought, that the lowers left on the tree develop into
 tender and ripe fruit, but when they are placed on the lotus feet
 -of Siva they would get for the worshipper elephants, horses, price¬
  less diamonds, etc. The alternative verse says “ A single flower
 placed on the feet of Siva out of pious devotion would get the
  blessed worshipper, emancipation from re-birth and also eternal
 bliss      Annamayya accepted the leaf and realising that this
 must have been given by Siva himself, felt immense joy and strung
  the leaf for record. In course of time he finished his sataka which
 contained 123 verses according to some manuscript copies and
  142 verses according to other manuscripts.
     This sataka contains verses which are in consonance with the
 tenets of the Virasaiva creed. Almost all the verses teem with the
 sentiment of devotion {bhakti rasa) the most essential and charac¬
 teristic feature of some satakas. Some of the verses in this sataka
 indicate the influence of Sivamahima stotra in Sanskrit and Somesvara
 sataka in Kannada on this poet, and some verses in their turn appear
 to have had their influence on the later Telugu poets, viz., Dhurjati
author of Sri KaleJiastisvara Sataka and Potana author of Narayana
Pataka. There are resemblances in thought and expression,
 between some verses of Annamayya’s Sarvesvara Sataka and some
 verses of Potana’s Narayana Sataka. It may be said that Anna¬
 mayya set the model sataka composition in Telugu and Kannada.
 He seems to have felt the influence of great thoughts from Sanskrit
 works like Mahima, Malharuiy Halayudha stotras and from Malli-
 kaijuna’s Sivatatvasara in Telugu. The spirit of tolerance towards
 other creeds is exhibited by Annamayya, unlike Panditaradhya,
 Palakuriki Somana and some other Virasivas.
     Vrishadhipa Satakam appears to be the second sataka in
-chronological order. It was composed b^ Palakuriki Somana

 ivho lived, according to the latest consensus of opinion among
 scholars, during the time of Prataparudra II of Warangal, probably
 during 1291—1320. He was also a great scholar of Sanskrit and
 Telugu and in course of time of Kannada. He composed
 Vrishddhipa Satakam after he had composed his Basavapurana, as is
 evident from one of the verses- of the sataka. The last words of
 the fourth line of each verse,              Basava\ Basava\ Basava\
  Vrishadhipal addressing Basava thrice, exhibit the depth of
 devotion he had towards Siva in the guise of Basavesvara. In
 verse, jVa yodayunda na vibhuda^ na kridayesvara na manorama.”
 we find the nayaki nayaka affinity in*the conception of the cordial
 relationship oi Jiva and Isvara emphasised by the Vaishnavas in
 their Visishtadvaita. This sataka set a good model for the
 subsequent satakas in the matter of elegant language, great thoughts
 and the sentiment of devotion. It contains verses which have
 figures of speech, alliteration, and rhymes and other stylitsic
beauties. It devotes some verses to incidents in the life of Basava,
 to the lives of devotees of Basava, and the greatness of Lord Siva.
    Sarabhankalinga Sataka is definitely the third sataka. The author
Sarabhanka addressed himself like Vemana and affixed linga to
 his name to lend the colour of addressing Lord Siva. The sataka
 was composed in 1323 or a little later, because he refers in his
sataka to the deplorable incident of the Mohammadans taking
 Prataparudra II as a captive to Delhi. He had been one of the
 ministers of that Kakatiya ruler at Warangal. His composition
is not so dignified or elegant as that of Annamayya or Somana,
-and yet may be regarded as a good piece of literature.
    The best among the Saiva Satakas is Sri Kalahastisvara Satakam
by Dhurjati of the 16th century. It contains, besides incidents
relating to the deity that were manifest at Kalashasti near Nellore
and expressions of piety and devotion to Lord Siva, beautiful
verses teeming with poetic conceits and elevated thoughts. The
language is elegant, dignified and rhythmic. Many verses have
^stylistic embellishments.
   Almost all the satakas upto the 16th century were Saiva, and I
wonder if th^re was any sataka worth mentioning that belonged
to the Vaishnava group in diis period. Some say that Tikkana
composed Krishna Sataka but there is no evidence to prove it.
It is a very popular Sataka but we are not definite about its author¬
ship or the date of its composition. There is another Krishna
 64                                 H25TORV OF TELUOU UTERATVSB

  Sataka composed by Chidella Ramakavi of the 19th century but
  it contains some points relating to metaphysics ^and is different
  from the Krishna Sataka which is in popular use.
     The only reliable sataka of the Vaishnava group of this period is
  the one that is addressed to Krishna! Devakinandana! There
  was in the case of this sataka also difference of opinion regarding
 the authorship. Some ascribed it to Kavirakshasa (or Bhima)
 of the early part of the 15th century and some others to Tikkana.
 But neither of the claims can be proved. There are, in some
 verses, grammatical errors which neither Kavirakshasa nor Tikkana
 could ever commit. The conviction among scholars is that it was
 composed by Vennelakanti Jannamantri, son of Siddhamantri,
 an officer in the service of Devaraya I of Vijayanagar who reigned
 from 1360 to 1420. This conviction is based on a statement made
 by Jakkana in his Vikramarka Charitra which was dedicated to
Siddha mantri. This sataka contains fine sentiments of devotion
 to Krishna besides tributes to the great and benevolent deeds of
Krishna.
    Another sataka of the Vaishnava group about which there is
some reliable information is Ontimetta Raghuvira Satakam which
was composed by Rayakavi Tippayya who is also known as
Ayyalarazu Tripurantaka. The latter is the real name given by
his parents but because he was a court poet in the time of Devaraya
II of Vijayanagar he assumed the title of Rayakavi, and Tippayya
was the contracted form of Tripurantaka and was more popularly
in use. His kinsmen of later times, viz., Ayyalarazu Ramabhadra
Kavi of the time of Krishnadevaraya and Ayyalarazu Bhaskara
Kavi of the last part of the 16th century, referred to Tippayya
 (or Tripurantaka) as the author of Ontimetta Raghuvira Sataka.
The closing words of each verse are generally Raghuvira Janaki^
nqjfoka. But in some verses, they are Ontimetta Raghumra
Jaaakinayaka! from which the name of the sataka is derived.
The reference is, therefore, to Rama that became manifest on
Ontimetta in the district of Kadappa.
    The first outstanding sateka of the Vaishnava group is Karaj^ana
Sataka which is generally ascribed to Bammera Potanamatya of
the latter half of the 15th century. There are, however, some
scholars who say that there is no reliable evidence to maintain t^at
it was composed by Potana. But I am strongly of the opinion
that Potana composed it, because the style o^composition is similar
DOVEREirr TYFBS OF UTERATURE                                       65

to that of his Bhagavatam. One of the verses, “ dhara simhasanamai
nabhambu godugai.” has a very bold conception. It means:

        May Thou, O! Narayana, flourish with the Earth as
     Thy throne, the Firmament as Thy Umbrella, the Gods
     as Thy servants, the Vcdk: chants as Thy minstrels, the
     Universal Globe as Thy form, Lakshmi as Thy consort,
     Brahma as Thy son, the Ganges as Thy daughter—with
     all these emblems of Royalty!

    Neither Krishnadevaraya nor the poets of his court seem to
 have evinced interest in the composition of Satakas. But after
 the time of Krishnadevaraya, there appeared a good crop of
 Sataka literature and the Satakas of the Vaishnava group out¬
 numbered those of the Saiva group.
    The most popular Satakas are Vemana Salakam (already noted)
 Sumati Satakam by Baddena, also known as Bhadra Bhupala,
 chieftain of a small principality in the middle of the 13th century;
Bkaskara Satakam by Marava Venkayya prior to the time ol'Appakavi
 (about 1650 because he quoted the authority of this Sataka);
Dasaratki Satakam by Kancherla Gopana also known as Ramadas
during the latter part of the 17 th century; aLodKavichoudappa Satakam
 (s€^->addressed) of the 17 th century.
    There are some scholars who think that the satakas belong to
an inferior branch of literature, but there is no justification for
such a sweeping condemnation. Though there may be some
satakas which are of no poetic merit, it cannot be dttiied that
sa^kas like Sarvesvara Satakam^ Sri Kalahasiisvara Satakam^ Bkaskara
Satakam are great pieces of Telugu literature which inspire the
reader.
    Some satakas which have been already noticed exhibit devotion
to God; some others expose the social evils of the time; yet others
l&e Madana Gepala Satakam by Vankayalapati Venkata Kavi of
about 1800 A.D. contain erotic sentiment and some satakas like
 Vmamy Sumati, Kumari and Putra contain moral precepts for
children.     •
   There are several good poets and scholars who arc very earnest
about composing them. Mandapaka Parvatisvara Sastri (1833—
1897) an eminent scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu, composed
twenty-three satcdcas besides other works. One of them, Hari-
      5
  66                               HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

   hareswara Satakam, was addressed to a deity who combined in
   Him the qualities of Siva and Vishnu. To jjhis deity that
   was manifest at Nellore, Tikkana dedicated his Mahabharatam
   addressing the deity as Hari-Hara-Natha. The concept of such
   a deity arose at a time when the conflict between Saivas and
  Vaishnavas was severe in the cefuntry. The smartas among
  Brahmans held the balance even, between these two creeds.
  Some of them in course of time became either Vaishnavas or
  Saivas. Tallapaka Annamacharya belonged to Nandavarika
  community of Brahmans. He embraced Vaishanavism and the
  members of Tallapaka family have ever since been Vaishnavites.
  Tenali Ramalinga kavi was at first a Saiva and in course of
  time embraced Vaishnavism and came to be known as Rama-
  krishna. So was Tenali Annayya, his younger brother and
  author of Sudakshimparinayam.
    Ainalapurapu Sanyasi kavi of Pzilateru near Bobbili (1820—1860)
 composed more than one hundred satakas, only 32 of which have
 survived. He was a Saiva and belonged to the kulala (potter)
 caste. He was very pious and gifted. He composed, besides
 satakas, three prabandhas including Rudraksha Alahatmyam (the
 marvellous power of the seeds of the tree termed Etoeocarpus
 ganitrus used for rosaries or sacred beeds by the Saivites).
    His compositions are full of stylistic embellishments and they
 exhibit the author’s poetic talent.
    Ghintalapalli Viraraghava kavi of about 1750 is considered to
 be a very talented poet. He says in his prabandka, Madhuravani
 Vilasam, that he composed a sataka in three hours and received
golden bracelets as a reward; but we do not know the name of
that sataka.
    Komaragiri Sanjiva kavi is another poet who composed his
sataka, Sasanka Sekhara, in six hours.
    There were poets who exhibited their skill in performing
acrobatic feats in their poetic compositions—satakas as well as
prabandhas. Ganapavarapu Venkata kavi was a gifted poet who
had the patronage of Muddalagiri, ruler of Tanjore about 1674.
He was the author of many books relating to the Telugu language,
grammar, poetics, lexicons, etc., as well as prabandhas. He
composed a Tamaka Sataka, the verses of which are full of Tamaka
or alliteration. The sataka known as Koeeherla dhama by Gade
Adisesha kavi of 1835 contains verses in         metre composed in
 DIFFERENT TYPES OF LITERATURE                                       67

 such a way that parts of a verse constitute a separate verse of
 another class of metre {garbha kavitvam) with a definite and
 complete thought in itself.
    Satakas are rarely addressed to the Goddess of learning.
 Vendigantam Gurunatham composed a sataka addressing Sarasvati
 and the present writer composed his Bharati Satakam in 1940.
    Satakas are usually devoted to the praise of a deity or the out¬
 pouring of devotion to God. Some satakas express erotic sentiment,
 or speculate on philosophy, morals or the social evils to be rectified.
 They do not deal with lexicography or linguistics polemics. There
 are however, a few exceptions. Kasturi Ranga kavi who dedicated
 his Lakshana Chudamani {Anandarangaratchhandam) a work on prosody
 in verse, in about 1750 to Ananda Ranga Pillai, interpreter
 (dubhashi, Skt. dvibhashi) to Dupleix, the French Governor in
 India, composed a lexicon of Telugu words in sisa metre in which
 the last line of each verse ends with ‘ Samba! ’ and it contains
 more than a hundred verses to satisfy the name of a sataka. In
 this respect also, Bharati Satakam deserves notice because it relates
 to the science and art of language and appeals to Bharati (the
 Goddess of Learning) to pronounce her verdict on the controversy
regarding the modern (or spoken) language. It contains 145
verses.
    Many poets commenced their literary career with an exercise
in sataka composition. In modem times the number of satakas
has considerably increased, and some of tliem contain good verses
and exhibit the poetic talent of their authors.
    I shall close my account of sataka literature by quoting from a
typical sataka^ a few verses to illustrate how the Sanskrit diction
dominates, and how the poet mentions some details regarding his
parentage, his guru and the community to which he belongs. For
this purpose, I shall select Dasarathi Satakam, a very popular satdea
by Kancherla Gopanna (also known as Ramadas) of Bhadrachalam
during the latter part of the 17th century. I quote the first five
verses because they are full of Sanskrit words and compounds,
and are intelligible not only to the Telugus but also to ail Indians
who know Sanskrit.

                      Yakshaoana Literature


   Of the three classes of celestial or supernatural beings, the
Yakshas, tlic Gandharvas and the Kinneras, the Yakshas were
attendants on Kubera, the god of wealth and were employed to
guard his treasure-house. They occasionally appear as imps of
evil, and a Taksha-gre^ is a being possessed by a Yaksha, an
evil spirit. But the Yakshas are generally regarded as inoffensive
  DIFFERENT TYPES OF LITERATURE                                     69

    and arc also known as punya-jarm, good people. They were
    nowhere spoken of as beings with special attainments in music
    or other fine arts. Kalidasa, however, chose to make a Yaksha
    the hero of his poem Meghadvia, The Gandharvas were of two
   classes—the Gandharvas of Vedic lore and the later Gandharvas*
   The former had their dwelling in the sky or atmosphere. One
   of their duties was to prepare the heavenly soma-juice for the gods.
   The Gandharvas of Indra’s heaven were known to be singers
   and musicians, particularly at the banquets of the gods. The
   GRndharvas of later times like Vartidlnni, heroine of Manucharitramf
   had their abode on the mountains {Markandeya Parana). Gandhafva-
   veda is the science of music and song, including drama and dance.
   The Kinneras are known as celestial choristers and musicians and
   they had their dwelling in the paradise of Kubera in Kailasa.
   Kinnera is also the name of a kind of the Indian vina or lute.
      In the light of these accounts, Takshagana should sound like a
  crow’s song. But though we do not hear of Takshganas in Sanskrit
  literature, we have them in southern India; and we have to under¬
  stand what the name indicates. I think—^but I am subject to
  correction—that while the music of a higher type like that of the
  Gandharvas appealed to the cultured classes, the music of a lower
  order expressed through the folksongs of the countryside appealed
  to the common people and such music came to be known ai
  Takshagana. The Telugu word for Yakshas is Jakkulu, evidently
 derived from the Sanskrit word. And Jakkulu, as G.P. Brown’s
 Dictionary says, are wizards who worship Kamesvari corresponding
 to Circe of the Greek legend. They sang songs, and danced as
 they sang. In course of time their songs and dances attracted the
 attention of the more cultured classes. The Takshagana literature
 seems to have evolved out of the songs and dances of Jakkus
 (Yakshas) in the villages.
     The earliest reference to folk-songs and dances occurs in Pandi-
 taradhya Charitram by Palakuriki Somana of the 13th century, whm
 he describes the various sports in the Sivaratri night, the 14th day
of the wan^ in the month of Magha regarded as sacred to Siva.
 Among the sports were mentioned pole-dances, rope-dances,
shadow-plays, as well as folk-songs and dances. In that connec¬
tion, it was said that the dance-dramas were also played, and that
the actors with dresses appropriate to their roles came to the
front of the stage firom behind a curtain. Though the expression
70                                   HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

  Takshagana was not used, a reference was made to those that sang
 and danced as * having become Gandharva, YakshafVidyadharas,
 etc.’   {Gandharva^ Taksha^ Vidyadharadulai padedun adeduvaru—
 vide Panditaradhya Charitram, Parvata Prakaranam^ cd.               by
  Dr. C. Narayana Rao). But Palakuriki Somana does not seem
  to have described w'hat exactly took place. He would mix up
 fact and fiction and mention all kinds of dances mentioned in
 Bharata Sastra and refer to all melodics {ragas), all kinds of tunes or
 measures in music, and all kinds of gestures, etc. catalogued in
 the science of music and ‘dafice. We cannot, therefore, say
 definitely if any Takshagana existed in his time. Nor does Pala¬
 kuriki Somana seem to have composed any Takshagana. The only
 position that we can possibly maintain is the existence of folk¬
 songs and folk-dances which could be the basis for the development
 of the later Takshagatias.
    The next reference to dance-dramas was made by Srinatha of
  1375—1430. In his Kridabhiramam, a kind of mclo-drama (meant
 for reading rather than acting), he introduced a woman of Jakkula
 caste {Jakkula purandhri) who depicted the role of the goddess,
 ‘ Kamavati Mahalakshmi ’ and entered the stage singing the
 love story of Vishnu (vide Sisa verse, ‘ Konagra sangharsha ghuma
ghuma dhvani tara kantha svarambu to garavimpa .... kinkini guch^-
hambu talamanambu to melavimpa .... kamavati Mahalakshmi
kaitabhari valapu paduchu vachche jakkula purandhrV), In his
 prabandha, Bhimesvara Puranam^ he describes how a danseuse played
the role of Annapurna, the wife of Siva, with a cup made of opal
in her hand, and danced amorous measures in connection with
a temple festival of Daksharama (vide Sisa verse, Virula dandalatodi
  .... sani isaniyai _ marulu nrityambu jagamula marulu golupu).
In his prabandha, Kasi Khandam, Srinatha mentioned that women
used to enact plays on a raised platform to the accompaniment of
song and musical instruments, during the time when Siva was
worshipped (vide verse ‘ vallaki chakki kahalamu vamsamUy dhakka
hudakka jhargharul .... prabandhamul .... adudur~agravedipai balla~
vapanuly Isvaruni banta matrisulu puja seyagan').
    The third reference was made by Pingali Surana of the sixteenth
century in bis prabandhay Prabhavaii Pradyumnamy to a kind of
melodrama or song drama as well as the dance-dramas (vide
verse—* a vanajaksha nandanudu-n-^ntata nandi dagambatinchi impava-
Mlam barochanayun amnkhamun danarara-n-oppa %rastavanato mukhadtd
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LITERATURE                                      71
 agu, sandhulu sangata hempu mira Gmgaoataradi mtakamul aden
 anekamul adbhutambugan, and verse, ' Saravi chanchatputa chapa putod-
ghatta ...Eladiprahandkachayamu tan natya karma pravartanamuna ’).
   Whether they were called Natakas as in Kridabhiramam (vide
 verse ‘ lessagaga kirata yi lema ckaritam aduduru natakambuga
 or Sringara Nataka geya prabandhas as in the Colophon of Sri Vira-
 bhadra Vijayam by Sivalenka Mallanaradhya of the same century,
they meant a type of musical drama. They were not like the
Sanskrit dramas of Kalidasa, or the English dramas of Shakespeare.
The name Takshagana Prabandham \^s mentioned in the colophon
of Sn Basava Kalyana Takshagana Prabandham by Anumoda Sanyasi
(vide Annals of Oriental Research: Centenary number. University
of Madras, article on the early Andhra stage by S. Rama-
krishna Sastri).
   Ramakrishna Sastri’s article on * Yakshagana: Origin and
Growth ’ published in Triveni January 1958, contains some
very valuable statements:

        * Yakshagana in its early stages was only a song as
     denoted by the term, without any prominence to dance.
     It does not mean that it is a certain kind of music or song.
     It was called after the caste of the people who sang in the
     beginning in Andhra desa. It was purely a desi art
     without the influence of Bharata Sastra ’. (The caste
     of the people referred to is the caste of Jakkulu probably
    gollas or enadis).
       ‘ The Andhras were the pioneers in the field of Yaksha¬
    gana and with their influence only, Yakshagana developed
    in Tamil and Kannada areas. The Telugu Yakshagana
    might be responsible to some extent for the development of
    Kathakali in Malabar .... They (in Malabar) felt it difficult
    and inconvenient on the part of the actors both to sing and
    dance at the same time, and hence reserved simple acting to
    the actors and supplemented singing by accompaniments.
    The Kannadigas might not have liked the mute dances of
    the Kafhakali of Malabar and followed with appreciation
    the Telugu Yakshaganas by both singing and dancing
    simultaneously.
       * From the beginning of the 16th century Kuchipudi
    Brahmans took up the profession in troupes and toured aU
72                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

     over South India giving the Yakshagana performances. In
     these troupes men took up the roles of women and acted
     the Drama.*

    As my subject is the History of Telugu Literature, I shall not
  enter into further details regarding the art of performing the
  Yakshaganas. I shall trace the history of Yakshagana Literature,
    Sugriva Vijayam seems to be the first Takshaganay composed
 about 1570 by Kandukuru Rudra kavi. It was dedicated to
 Janardanaswami of Kandukuru. The fall of Vali and the triumph
 of Sugriva is the theme of the drama.
    This was followed by a bumper crop of Takshganas in South
 Indian Literature in Tanjore.
    Gajendramoksham, Rukmini Krishna Vivaham and Janakiparinayam
 wre the three Yakshaganas composed by Raghunatha Nayak of
 Tanjore (1600—31). But they are lost to us. Raghunatha Nayak
 was a great scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu and of music. It is
 said that he composed Parijatapaharanam, a prabandhay ex¬
 temporaneously in six hours and had the honour of being ‘ bathed
 in gold ’ by his father, Achyutaraya, during the last years of the
 16th century.
    Vijaya Raghava Nayaka (1633—1673) was the author of 23
 Yakshaganas or musical dramas. I shall mention a few which
 are worthy of notice on account of the poetic merit. Raghunatha^
 bhyttdayatn is 2^. yakshagana drama in which the erotic sentiment is
 predominant. It relates to the incidents in the life of his father,
 Raghunatha Nayaka; it describes how a beautiful and accomplished
damsel, Chitrarekha, fell in love with Raghunatha Nayaka, sent
a parrot with a love-letter, and gained his love. It contains also
an account of the literary entertainments in the court of Raghunatha
Nayaka. It mentions the achievements of the poetesses in his
court viz., Ramabhadramba and Sukavani. Special mention
is made of the competition of filling up the verses with only the
last line (sometimes the first line) given out {Samara puranam),
    Vipranarayana Charitra is another Yakshagana which excels in
some poetic aspects. Sarangu Tammaya’s prabimdha, Vipra-
narayana Charitra (also known as Vaijayanti Vilasam) composed in
 1510 and Ghadalavada Mallana*s work of the same name composed
in 1580. The end rhymes are apt and entertaining. For example»
they run thus:
 DlVFERfiNT TYPES dF LITERATURE                                   73
     * Chadivedi divya prahandhamu
     maku saipadu samara bandhamu
     Togindrulatone maku sambandhamu *

    It contains popular expressions and the varying dialectal forms
 appropriate to the characters are used. These include Tamil
 expressions also.
    In the Takshagandf Putana haranam, the story of Bala Krishna
 taking out the life of Putana is described. In the introductory
 portion an account of the twelve Alvars is presented which shows
 that Vijaya Raghava had profound devotion to Vishnu.
    Some of the other Takshaganos relate to the popular stories
 mentioned in the Bhagavata, viz., Govardhanoddharanamf Rukmini
 Kalyanam, Satyabhamavivahamy Radha Madhavam, Ushaparmayaniy
 Kamsa Vijayam etc.
    VijayaRaghava Kalyanam was composed by Koneti Dikshitachandra
who was the recipient of honours and grants of land from Vijaya
 Raghava. The theme of this drama is the marriage of Vijaya
 Raghava and Kantimati.
    Tanjapurannadana maha natakam, by Purushothama Dikshita
during the time of Vijaya Raghava, is an interesting play in which
it is said that fifty thousand Brahmans were fed everyday with a
sumptuous meal in the several choultries {satrams) of Tanjore.
The words shouted on the occasion should refer to the details of
the various dishes served, or to be served, and to the rejoicings
of tlie Brahmans that were present there. The dishes cooked and
served are all of the Andhra type.
    Vijaya Raghava Chandrikavilasam composed by Kamarsu Venkata-
 pati Somayaji, a court-poet of the king, is a love story connected
with Vijaya Raghava. It contains descriptions of Tanjore and
its attractive buildings and a sketch of Vijaya Raghava, his personal
handsomeness, his learning and patronage. A beautiful and
accomplished young woman sends a love letter in verse to Vijaya'
Raghava and wins his favour.
   Mannarudasamlasa natakam, by Pasupuleti Rangajamma is a very
interesting yakshagatia full of humour, erotic sentiment, poetic
concepts and beautiful descriptions. The dialogues between the
purohits and the astrologers both of a low rank, arc all in their
habitual dialect. Rangajamma displayed equal skill in presenting
the thoughts of the less cultured folk as well as that of cultured
 74                                HISTORY OF TELOOU LITERATURE

   leaders of society. The theme of the drama centres round the
   love affairs relating to Vijaya Raghava Nayak and Kantimati.
   Once during the festivities connected with a temple dedicated to
   Raja Gk)pala Swamy at Tanjore, Kantimati the daughter of
  Rajachandra Maharaja, a ruler of neighbouring principality
  happened to see Vijaya Raghava alid was overcome by the pangs
  of love. After returning home, she sent Vilasavati, her friend,
  to the king with a love message. The king, who was charmed
  by the grace and the literary gifts of Kantimati, was eager to
  marry her. Meanwhile, fcm|ile soothsayer of the Erukula caste
  had come to Kantimati and predicted that the king would agree
  to marry her. Vilasavati then returned with the good news and
  cheered Kantimati. Vijaya Raghava was also love-sick and
  anxious to know if Rajachandra would consent to give Kantimati
  in marriage to him. Tatayacharya, the royal priest, went to the
  abode of Rajachandra and recommended the matrimonial alliance.
  Rajachandra accepted the proposal and the marriage was solemni¬
 sed. Rangajamma describes the great rejoicing on the occasion,
 and how songs of various styles were sung by the women.       The
 songs give us an insight into the social conditions then prevailing
 and the pranks of the frolicsome young women on such occasions.
     Sahaji or Saha Maharaj (1681—1712) son of Ekoji, the first
 ruler of Tanjore after the downfall of the Nayak rulers, was a
 gifted poet and scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu. A list of his
 literary productions is given in this book under Tanjore (Vide
 Ch. IV). I shall, therefore, furnish here some interesting details
 of the more important yakshanaganas composed by Sahaji. The
yakshagana was marvellously transformed by the Tanjore poets,
 particularly when Sahaji adopted it as a literary form. Besides
Nandi and Amukham, the introduction of Sutradhari^ the Stage-
 manager, the prayer to Vinayaka and other features based on
 Sanskrit dramaturgy, the early tradition of yakshanagana was
maintained in providing songs at every stage. The technique
of the song dramas evolved during these days continued to dominate
the Telugu stage, upto about 1880. The Telugus then developed
a taste for the production of dramas like those of Halidasa and
Shakespeare. In regard to the style and language, Sahaji
maintained the rhythmic poetic diction for prose, and the classical
language of the prabandhas for verse, with a profuse use of the
popular forms which had come into use, thofigh they were not
DIFFERENT TYPES OF LITERATURE                                      75
recognised by old grammar. The language used is throughout
simple and intelligible to the ordinary Telugu audience possessing
the traditional culture of the times.
   In Tyagaraja vimda chitraprabandha mtaka^ we notice at the
commencement sentences in Sanskrit, ex. Matyarambhe ishta cUvata
prarthanamkaromi: churnika—ihaknalucharachara vandita padaravinde ..
etc. The sutradhara, after announcing the name of the drama
to be enacted, in rhythmic prose, appeals to the audience to correct
the mistakes (either in the composition or the performance of the
play) and witness the performance t This drama provides for
speeches, some in Sanskrit, some in Telugu and some in Marathi?
   In some of the dramas there is a colophon relating to the author¬
ship. For example, in Pancharatna prabandham, the last verse
runs thus:

    * Sahitya pumbhava sarada yaina
    Saha bhupala sasankudu rachinche
    sarasa satkavulella sannuti seya
    dharanilo—achandra iararkamugan ’

   It means, the ruler, Sahabhupala, who is the incarnation of
Sarasvati in male form, composed (this) so that it may be praised
by all the discerning poets and live in the country as long as the
moon, the stars and the sun exist (in the universe).
   Though the author of the          yakshagana is Sahaji, the portion
allotted to Sutradhara is written in such a way that it appears to be
the composition of the Sutradhara^ vide, for example, the introductory
portion of Parvatiparinayam.

    ' Sakala vidya vilasamulache ranjillu
    Sahabhupaiuni sannutinchi ’

    ‘ a maharqju paramesvarankitamuga
    paraga chesina Parvaliparinayakhya-
    manedu natakam a raju-n-anumatamuna
    vesha bhashadi yutamuga vistarintu *

  It means; Having extolled Sahabhupala who shines bright with
a knowledge of all arts and learning .... I shall now proceed
with the performance of the drama known as Parvatiparinayam,
   T6                                 HISTOAY OF TELUOU LtTEilATUftE

   composed by that Maharaja and dedicated to Paramesvara, with
   the permission of that king. The drama closes with a benediction
   as though it was written by some other than the poet himself.
      Sahendra Charitam is a yakshagana by Giriraja who was renowned
   as a court-poet under the patronage of Sahabhupala. He was
   Well versed in music and literature. He continued to be the
   court-poet under Sarabhoji (1712—1728) the brother and successor
   of Sahaji. In the songs composed in honour of Sahaji by Giri
   raja, interesting references to Sahaji are made as in-
                            -f


        * Giriraja rmta! ni rommuna ckedarina gandhamu andamu
        Mudamuna Sahendra! mugudala gudina chandamu *

       It means: * O! Sahaji, praised by Giriraja! the beauty of the
    sandal paste, scattered on thy chest, exhibits the grace of the
   embraces of the damsels! ’
      Likewise, the address made to Sarabhoji appears in: * Kopa
   kattega Giriraja nuta! Sarabhojinripa! ’ It means: ‘ Like an offended
   damsel, O! Sarabhoji! praised by Giriraja! ’
      The theme of this yakshagana is, as usual, a love affair. The
   Maharaja and a girl develop mutual love and ultimately they
   come together and the girl’s mother is richly rewarded.
      Lilavati parinayam another yakshagana composed by Giriraja
   relates to the marriage of Sarabhoji with Lilavati, the daughter
   of Kirti Chandra Raja, the lord of Kalyanapura.
      Giriraja composed also Vada Jayamu^ Sarvanga Sundari Vilasamu
  and Ramamohana Koravanji as yakshanas and they were all addressed
  to Sahaji.
      There is another yakshagana known as Lilamti Saharajiyam,
  composed by Balakavi Subbanna in the time of Sahaji. It refers
  to another Lilavati whom Sahaji married.
      Tulajaji, also known as Tukkoji, was the younger brother and
  successor of Sarabhoji. He was the ruler of Tanjore from 1728—
  1736. He was a great scholar of Sanskrit and Tclugu and was
  well-versed in music. He composed the drama known as Sivakama
  Sundariparinayam. It was praised as a drama which could be
  appreciated by the cultured section of the audience on accoimt
  of the dignity of style and richness of thought.
     ParijatapahartMaM is a drama of the yal^kagana type, (»ttiposed
^ by Matru Bhutayya and dedicated to Amarasimha, son of PfratEpa-
 IMPFERSNT TYPES OP WTERATUR®                                    77
  simha and successor of Tulajaji II. Amarasimha ruled for one
  year only (1788—1789), but became famous as the patron of
  Matni Bhutayya.
     The circumstances which led Matru Bhutayya to the court of
  Pratapasimha, the father of Amarasimha, and encouraged him to
  compose Pqrijatapaharanam are very interesting. Matru Bhutayya
  was at first a resident of Pudukkota. He was a great scholar of
  Sanskrit and Telugu and was well versed in music. He was also
  a good poet. But he was desperately poor. At Pudukkota there
  was a temple known as ‘ Tayuman Koil ’ in Tamil, and as Matru
  bhutesvara in the locality. Matru Bhutayya, whose name was
  derived from the name of Matru Bhutesvara, was a devotee of
  Sugandhi Kuntala Devi, consort of Matru Bhutesvara. He
 composed many songs in praise of the deity and prayed to her for
 some means of livelihood. On hearing one of his songs which
 was—Kasikappanam ivalan ammi the deity Sugandhi Kuntalamba
 appeared in his dream and said: ‘ There is my devotee Pratapa¬
 simha, ruler of Tanjore; approach him and he will help you and
 keep you above want.* That very day the poet started to
 approach the king and the deity appeared in the king’s dream and
 said, ‘ I am sending one of my devotees to you; help him and
 keep him above want.’ Pratapasimha then eagerly looked for
 the arrival of Matru Bhutayya and, when the latter arrived, the
 king welcomed him, gave him ten thousand rupees and directed
 him to proceed to Trisiragiri where he could live in comfort and
 peace and compose his songs. When Amarasimha came to the
 throne he was invited to Tanjore. Sivaraya, the minister of Amar-
simha encouraged him to compose a drama of ths yakshagana type
and dedicate it to the king. The incidents are mentioned in the
colophon of Parijatapaharanam which the poet composed as a drama
of the yakshagana type. The theme is a well-known story from
the Bhagavatam.
    There arc in this drama interesting descriptions of several
classes of people, particularly the cowherd girls representing the
gopikas who usually gathered round Gopala Krishna. There i?
an interesting i^erse in which a girl who sells butter-milk (challa)
says that in return fox the butter-milk she gave, she got her nose¬
ring from Sukra, her earrings from the Sun, her necklaces fi:om
the moon, her bracelets from Indra, her locket for the forehead
78                                HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

from Siva, and her head-ornaments known as Suryachandra
 from Sarasvati.                                     ••
    There is an appealing description of the butter-milk she was
 selling, in eleven lines of dvipada metre.
    The famous Tyagaraja who lived in the time of the Tanjore
 ruler, Sarabhoji II, dedicated his* songs to Rama to whom he was
 deeply devoted. He refused to dedicate them to Sarabhoji though
 requested by him and also implored by his elder brother and some
 intimate friends. He composed, in addition to his songs, two
yakshagmas known as ^Naykacharitra and Prahlada Bhaktivijayam.
 They were meant to be sung without dance. The theme in both
 of them is based on the traditional stories. They contain
 introductory verses, songs of description, dialogues in songs, and
 prose-passages to serve as connecting links. They are not operas
 because there is no acting or dancing though there is abhinaya
 while they are sung, in order to convey the meaning of the songs
or verses. They may be called song plays or yakshagana natakas
in the original sense of the word, yakshagana.
   Tyagaraja liked the story of Prahlada because it was similar
 to his own story, in the matter of deep devotion which cannot be
shattered by threats or adverse circumstances.
   J^aukacharitra has a higher artistic merit than Prahlada Bhakti
vijayam. Complete surrender to God is the main idea in this musical
play. The gopis once requested Krishna to accompany them
on a boat excursion on the waters of the Yamuna. Krishna
complied with their request. He was seated in the middle, while
all the gopis sat round him. The gopis were humoured by
Krishna with talks of love. They felt that it was their beauty
and charm that attracted Krishna, and they were all proud of
their accomplishments. Krishna thought of teaching them a
lesson with the object of rendering them humble, and purifying
their souls. He conjured up a violent wind which tossed the
boat, and, what was worse, the boat developed many leaks through
which water was entering into the boat. The gopikas were
seized with utter consternation and felt helpless. Krishna then
coolly asked them to remove all their garments" and plug the
cracks with them. The gopikas then surrendered to Krishnay
bereft all vanity, and prayed to Him with all devotion and humility,
expressing their conviction that He alone could be their saviour*
Krishna 'then called off the gale and blessed* them.

      Mcratur Vcnkatarama Sastri (1807—1860) who was well-
  versed in music and Telugu, composed twelve Takshagana
  dramas with popular themes like Prahlada Charitray Usha Parinayam
  Rukmini Kalyananiy Sita Kalyananiy etc. They were meant for
  singing, dancing and acting in all of which the musical aspect
  is richer than the poetical element.
     Annapurna Parinayam is a yakshagana drama by Sivaji Maharaj,
  ruler of Tanjore during 1833—1855, the last king of Tanjore. In
  the introductory portion consisting of songs, verses and prose
  passages, the Sutradhara depicts the ^en^alogy of the Maharashtra
  rulers and gives an account of the greatness of Sivaji. The story
  centres round Konkanesvara of a temple at Tanjore and describes
  how he happened to marry Annapurna Devi. Konkana was
  a siddha and an expert in Alchemy {Rasavada Sastra). He
  performed a penance and prayed to Siva for gifts. Siva who was
  pleased with his devotion appeared and granted his request^
  according to which the Siddha was manifest at Tanjore as
  Konkanesvara and the people built a temple for the new deity
  who was endowed with miraculous powers of granting the requests
  of the devotees and healing their ailments. An interesting account
  is given in one of the manuscripts at Tanjore which furnishes a
  list of actors that participated in the performances, the dramatis
  personae consisting of Konkanesvara, Vighnesvara, the seven
  hermits etc., among males and Annapurna, Sukavani, Manjuvani,
  Tilottama and others among females.
     Sivaparijatam is a yakshagana drama by Konakajetti Venkata
  Krishnajetti a poet patronised by Sivaji. It contains a few
 miraculous stories of Siva.
     Takshanagas were also composed by the Telugu poets at Madhura
 tmder the patronage of the Nayak rulers. Vijayarangachokkanatha
  (1704—1731) is considered to be the best among the rulers. He
 was a patron of letters and was himself an author. He wrote in
 prose Sri Rcmga Mahatmyam and Magha Mahatmyam in the spoken
 dialect. Tirumalakavi, grandson of the famous Balasaravati
 and son of Venkatadhvari composed Chitrakuta Mahaimyam as a
yakshagana dmma. The story refers to an incident in the life of
 Siva. Parvati went once to Chitrakuta and stayed there as,
 * Tillavanini ’. Siva felt the pangs of separation, searched for
her and came to know of her whereabouts from his attendants.
80                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

He went there under the pretext of hunting and met her. He
spent four days at that place and returned with hfir to his abode.
   At Mysore also, Tclugu literature flourished under the patronage
of the rulers. Kanthirava Raja who reigned from 1704 to 1713
was the author of about fourteen works of the Takshagana type.
Among them were Koravanji katle,, Panchayudha katle^ Vasantotseaia
 Vilasamy Lakshmi Vilasam, Ashtadikpalaka Vilasam, Parvati natakamy
kauberi natakam. There are, as in some other yakshaganas already
noticed, Sanskrit slokas at the commencement, Tclugu verses of
the desi metres as well as a few vritlas and prose passages and
songs with the names of ragas and time measure.
   In Koravanji katle there are (1) Andhra Koravanji, (2) Kannada
Koravanji (3) Prakrit Koravanji and (4) Tamila Koravanji.
   In Panchayudha Katie there are many Sanskrit slokas. It depicts
how the five weapons of Vishnu protect Kanthirava. Vasantotsava
 Vilasam is an interesting yakshagana drama. It commences with
a Sanskrit sloka of benediction and next introduces the Sutradkara
and JVati as in Sanskrit drama. After tlie former announces the
name of the drama, the latter sings a song describing the season
of spring {vasanta). There is a reference to the presence of
Kanthirava seated on the throne among the audience, and the
list of dramatis personae is announced; Mallika, Mandarika,
Manju Bhashini, Madhuravahini, etc. The female roles were
enacted as at Tanjore by women and not by men as in Kuchipudi
dance dramas. The name of the raga and tala is Indicated in the
case of each song. Erotic sentiment predominates in almost all
the songs.
   Ganga Gouri Vilasam is v^yakshagana composed by Peda Kemparaya
who ruled Bangalore principality from 1513-^156ft. He dedicated
his work to Somesvarasvami at Halsur, It is of the ordinary
type and it relates the story of Ganga and Gouri who altercate
with each other and maintain their individual supericMrity.
   Muktikanta Parinayam by Paramananda Tirtha, an ascetic m
Champakaranya kshetra of Tanjore territory who lived about 1€(K),
is a yakshagofia with a philosophical story of a wise individual
(vivekajiva) obtaining the lady of emancipation (mk^anta).
   Chandratara Vilasam is a yedtshagana by EUaya who dwelt m a
village known as Uddanda Mallasamudram in Salem. The atoiy
is the same as the well-known love episode of the moon (chandm)
and Tara, the wife of Brihaspati.

A note on Kormnji type of Takshaganas
  The origin of the name Koravanji is not quite clear. I cannot
accept the division of the word as kora and vanji because whatever
may be said of vanji in Tamil, kora cannot, be satisfactorily
accounted for.    I am disposed to think that this pattern of composi¬
tion originated from the Kouvas, a primitive tribe scattered in
all parts of South India.    They are generally devoted to pastoral
occupations,     ‘—an ’ is a personal suffix; koravan means a man
of the korava tribe; ‘ ~ji ’ is a termination to indicate the plural
number as in the Savara language (|nin=he, anin-ji; mandran=a
man, mandranji—men).        Koravanji means koravas; it is probably
a holophrastic word meaning ‘ of the koravas ’.
  The theme of Koravanji is generally a popular story, always
connected with the primitive people.
                           CHAPTER VII

         Influence of Western Culture on Telugu
                 Language and Literature

During    the Mohammedan period in the History of India many
foreign words crept into tive Indian languages first into the North
Indian languages and next into Telugu and the other South
Indian languages, with the Muslim invasions of the South from
the 14th century onwards. With the advent of the Portuguese to
the west coast, the Portuguese merchants found their way into the
Vijayanagar kingdom. During the two centuries from 1518 to
 1687 when the rulers of the Qutub Shahi dynasty held sway over
Telangana, the Telugus came into closer contact with Arabic*
Persian and Hindustani words, their administrative machinery
and culture. Words of their languages came to be used by the
Telugus of tliis region, and some of them found their way into
not only official letters and petitions but also into Telugu literature.
Though the rule of the Grolkonda Sultans ended in 1687, the
Muslini rule continued under the Nizams till recently. The
influence of Islam was not limited to Telangana; it extended to
the other parts of the Telugu country, with the result that hundreds
of words from Arabic, Persian and Hindustani got mixed up with
Telugu and many of them have been used by Telugu writers.
Just as, in English, it is not easy for the ordinary Englishman to
distinguish between what is Anglo-Saxon and what is foreign
among the words that are used by him, so it is difficult for the
ordinary Telugu men to distinguish their own words and the
foreign words in their language as it stands now. There are many
Telugus who think that the following are genuine Telugu words
and feel surprised when they are told that they are foreign:
kitiki, kamanu, divan (u) kurchi, kuza, dabbi, bazaru, nattu,
gundi, cheddi, sonnayi, etc.
   1, therefore, give a list of some more common foreign words
imder some categoric:
   and^    Ag ; ulture and Revenue'. Zaimndari, Jagir, Inam,
Takkavi, Farikattu, Galla, Firka, Irsalu, Vasulu, Vayida, Kistu,

   Srinatha seems to be one of the earliest Telugu poets to use
Hindustani words in his poems. In Haravilasam, for example,
he used kkusi (khushi) [vide verse 22 in the introductory section
* Kh^ miran Suradhana nindu koluvai-’]
   Sri Krishnadevaraya used baiuvul in his Amuktamalyada (vide
* Pakshachchhata gruchchi batuvulu-’)            Peddana, the poet-
laureate in his court, Jkeely used Hindustani words in his Manu-
eharUram, (Vide canto II. 8-29). Kanuparti Abbayamatya in his
 84                                  HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

  Aniruddha Charitram (vide c. 18-19) and Ayyalaraju Narayana kavi
  in his Hamsavimsati (Vide 350-356) used these foreign words in
  their poems. Rangaraya Charitra (the story of Bobbili battle) by
  Dittakavi Narayana has many Hindustani words, particularly
  those that refer to arms, weapons, etc., relating to warfare. Sishtu
 Krishnamurti of tlie 19th century composed a lengthy verse in
 which he made a profuse use of the Hindustani terms.
    The lexicographers included foreign words in their lexicons
 composed in verse. In Samba Mighantu for example, the lexico¬
 grapher said ‘ ekimidUy padushcy yelika, mannidu sahebUf rayadu.... *
 (vide Manavavarga),
    William Brown’s Lexicon ‘ A Vocabulary of Gentoo and English *
 published in 1807 was the first to arrange the words according
 to the alphabetical order. It contains foreign words, Hindustani
 as well as English and other languages.Ex. mahassulu, marifathi,
yizara^ farikhattu^ vasulu, etc.
    In Sabdaratnakaram, by B. Sitaramacharyulu, a standard Telugu
 Dictionary, many foreign words were included. Ex: khulasCy
 babpatUy bapure, bavidi, suba, subedaru, langoti etc.
    C. P. Brown published a Dictionary of Mixed Dialects as a
supplement to his Telugu Lexicon and presented in it, hundreds
of foreign words that came into use in Telugu, There is an
interesting example of how Telugu poets used some foreign
words with the conviction that they were genuine Telugu..
Vavilikolanu Subba Rao, a great poet who died a few years ago,
was a purist. In his grammar {Sulabha Vyakaranam) he condemned
the use of foreign words but used the word teji (Arabic, horse)
in his Subhadra Vijayam (p. 54), Kanlu teji meaning Cupid’s horse,
probably not realising that it is a foreign word. Paidimarri
Venkatapati used in his Chandrangada Charitra^ Bapure! vide
canto III. * Arare! danti; balire! Santi gunam ayyare! prasa-
dambu; Twqym.' dakshinyara                telivimcl-oAo.? tapamb-flKra.'
yadaramahamahimamb-oAo!            kalita    medha     sakti   mayyare!
Satkarunalokanam-anchu-n-atma muniratkanthira vun mcchchu-
chun ’. All the nine words that are italicised convey the same
sense of admiration or veneration but the poet ha& a fancy for
variety of expression. So he used all possible synonyms including
Bapure,
   In course of time the Telugus, like the other peoples of India,
came into contact with the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French
 INFLUENCE OF 'WESTERN CULTURE                                        85

   and the English, and leamt to use the words of these foreigners as
   occasion arose. It is interesting to note how the names of these
   western people came into use in Telugu. The Portuguese came
  to be known as Budatakichulu, the Dutch as Olandulu from Holland,
   the French as Parasulu^ from Paris, and the English as Anglejntlu
  from England.
     The Portuguese words that came into Telugu are:—Anasdi
   Alpi, Chadara, Tuvala^ Kofi, Saggu {biyyamu)^ BottamUy Pipa, Almara^
   Balchi, Tapela, Boppayi (pandu), KaptaiiUy Padiri {dora)^ Biskotu,
   {Biscuit)^ Mestri, Boriga, Katari, KanS, Turupu, (Pallaki) Bongu, etc.
     Some words shown in Brown’s mixed dialects as from Hindustani
  are probably from Portuguese; Ex. Kamizu (Port. Chamisa),
   Talarm chevi (Por—Chave, Hindustani—Ghabi), like these words
  which came into Arabic as well as Telugu and other Indian
  languages. Very few words came into Telugu from the Dutch.
  Battai pandu is so called because it came originally from Batavia,
  capital of the Dutch East Indies on the north west coast of Java,
  and the Batavian oranges were brought by the Dutch into India.
  Goyya {pandu)—Guava fruit was originally a fruit found in the
  tropical and subtropical regions of America. I’he Spanish name
  is Guayaba and the Portuguese name, Guajaba.
     Very few also are the words that came into Telugu from the
  French. Kusini {vadu) meaning a cook is from the French word
  Cui-sine, pronounced as Kwizhin meaning kitchen. Firangi is
  the word in Telugu for cannon that came from Frank, Francois
 meaning French. Firangi-chekka is a medicinal drug from China
  but used to cure Chitla-firangi, a kind of \'^enereal disease.
 Kamam is shown by Brown in the Mixed dialects as a Hindustani
 word but he writes in the explanatory note * meant for the French
 ** command ”, a march or military journey *. The word Kamam
 was originally used by the Telugus to mean a march of journey.
 MadamUy Madam in English, originally came from the French
 Madame pronounced as madam and is used in Telugu to mean
 the queen in the play at cards. Jaki meaning a Jack or knave
 in the play at cards is from Jaques, a French word.
     Hundreds of English words have been used in the language
;ipoken by the Telugus and many of them find a place in Telugu
literature from the 18th century onwards and they are profusely
used in modem prose literature. Some of these words find a
place in Sabdaratnakaram as well as in Brown’s dictionary. The

      Poets have not hestiated to make a free use of these foreign
    words as occasion arose. Some of these words have been so
    Tcluguised that the ordinary Telugu man thinks that they arc
    genuine Telugu words. For example, two words Rulsu and
    J^llu evolved out of the English word rule, the former with the
    English plural termination ‘ s ’ and the latter with the Telugu
    plural termination * lu ’ and are used with a difference in meaning,
    the former in the sense of regulations and the latter in the sense
    of lines drawn on paper or slate.

       As this passage is printed in Telugu character, he expressed the
    same in English character, the foreign words being marked in
    Italics:

            i number lo defendant^ summons, .. sign .. {daskat) ..
         waida .. court .. hazir .. answer .. ex~parte daryafi ..
         plaintiff pleader motion .. motion record dakhil (or file) ..
         darkhast .. proceedings .. order enter .,

,     This in English would run thus:

            ‘ The Defendant in this case, having seen the summons
         and having signed it, has failed to appear in Court at the
         fixed time to present his answer. The plaintiff’s pleader
         thereupon made a motion wherein he prayed that an ex~parte
         trial may be made; that motion was therefore filed in the
         record and an order was entered in the proceedings that
         this should be done according to his desire.*

   G. P. Brown adds that ‘ the instance now given is copied from
the journal of the court at Masulipatnam ’ and further says,
* The diary of any court of justice in the Telugu country will
furnish specimens of this useful though inelegant dialect.’
   As regards the use of the foreign words in Telugu poems by
poets, I may quote the authority of C. P. Brown in, addition to
what I stated on a previous page. He says: * The Hindustani
INFLUENCE OF WESTERN CULTURE                                      89

dialect is used in some modern Telugu poems, particularly in the
Radhamadhaaa Samvadamu^ Balarama Chantray Bhallana Charitra and
in many satakas. Even some poems of eminent merit such as the
Dasavatara Charitra and Kalapurnodayamu written by Pingali Smana
 admitted some Hindustani phrases. Thus in the days of Dryden,
Addison and Pope, many English compositions admitted French
or Dutch expressions *.
    Telugu poets of the twentieth century have taken a fancy to
 write poems or verses with a profuse use of English words. Bhoga-
raju Narayanamurti, for example, Mrrote a short poem known as
 Panduga-katnam (Festive present) in which occurs a verse:
    ‘ Postajisuna postu seyudoka jabun repu; namatalan testun
jeyaga vachchu; start imidiyetli yanchu vair ichchute best annintanu;
 vairu chuchukonuchun vevega meltrain lo ne start aun ata-da-
 aranalekada mikemaina m/ainacho.’
    In this verse, the English words used are—post office, post,
 test, start immediately, wire, best, mail, train, start and waste.
    In Sahdaralnakaramy a standard Telugu Dictionary by B. Sitarama-
charyulu, many English words like fiz, ardar, aspatri, steshanu,
 barishtaru, bordu, roddu, kamishan, charji, kalcktar, judgji,
 navambar, etc., are presented. Brown included many more
such words in his Dictionary of the Mixed Dialects and Foreign
words.
   It is impossible to avoid the use of such words while writing
books on modern topics and scientific subjects, though it is highly
desriable to avoid them, as far as possible, in Telugu poetry and
standard Telugu prose literature.
   I shall first refer to the great services rendered by emineni
western scholars in the field of Lexicons and Grammars.
   There were three classes of people among the western savants
who promoted learning and rendered literary service to the
Telugus: (1) Christian Missionaries, (2) Officials and merchants
and (3) Great scholars who studied Telugu language and literature
and acquired competency to prepare Telugu Dictionaries and
Telugu Grammars. Of these the Christian Missionaries were
interested in spreading the Christian faith among the Telugu
people and therefore, imdertook the translation of the Bible and
the writing of pamphlets and books relating to Christianity. The
offidula and,merchants were satisfied with a working knowledge
of the ‘ Vernacular *, But the scholars who studied Telugu
 90                                 HISTORY OF TBIUGU LIT5RATU|^

 rendered great service to the advancement of the study of Teiugu
 language and literature. It is said that so early a».about 1700 the
 French missionaries prepared a Teiugu Dictionary (Dictionaire
 Tclugu) and a Teiugu grammar (Gentoo Grammar). But what¬
 ever might have been their utility in their time, they were not of
 much use to the Telugus. G. P. Brown referring to the Dictionary
 prepared by them writes; * It was finely written in a minute
 French hand but not always easy to decipher. The authors have
 not given their names. I observe that they were indefatigable
 in recording the colloqui^ dialect alone. I never saw this book
 until I returned to England in 1855. It supplied more than a
 thousand phrases
    Referring to the Tclugu grammar by these French missionaries,
 W. Brown says in the preface lo his grammar of thq Gentoo
 language (vide p. xii): ‘ Though ample in the materials, it was
 found to be superfluously minute and perplexing in the detail, and
 so extremely incorrect in doctrine as well as matter, that little
other use was derived from it, except that of prompting the formation
of the present Grammar with the greater alacrity; if for no other
reason than that of rescuing the proper Gentoo from the perversion
and miscontractions, with which the French production is amply
teemed ’.
   Lexicons in Teiugu had been composed in verse and the words
had been arranged not according to the alphabetical order but
subject-wise as in Sanskrit Amarakosam under some groups such
as gods {deva vargu)y human {manushya vargu) etc. For the first
time in the history of Lexicography in Teiugu, William Brown
published his ‘ Vocabulary of Gentoo and English ’ in 1807
arranging the Teiugu words according to the alphabetical order;
but in so doing he introduced an innovation. Words beginning
with i, i, e and e are shown under y as yi, yi, ye and yS and wprtfe
beginning with u, u o and 6 are shown under v as vu, vu, vo and
v5 and words beginning with r such as rishi under r as in rushu
Another important point to be noted in this vocabulary is that
it is a very concise lexicon of not more than four thousand words
• ■                          t                                    t   *   M

and they relate to words which were in daily use, and words that
occurred only in books (classical literature) were excluded.
   Nine years later in 1816, Manoiidi Venkayya prepared       Telt||;||
pictipmiry according to the Tclugu alphabetical prdcr, p^entipg
the meanings in Teiugu only. His book was Iprinf^ aijd
INFLUENCE OF WESTERN CULTURE                                     91
in 1848. This dictionary included words from Telugu literature,
whether or not they were in daily use, and excluded what he
considered to be ‘ corrupt * words and revenue or ofEcial terms.
   A few years later on A.D. Campbell published his Telugu
Dictionary. Jayanti Ramayya Pantulu was either not aware of
the existence of W. Brown’s lexicon or ignored it as not worth
consideration, when he said in the preface to the Su^araya Andhra
JVigkantuvu (Vol. I) that A. D. Campbell was the first to publish a
Telugu Lexicon with words arranged in Telugu alphabetical
order. Campbell must have acquirtd a fair knowledge of Telugu
language and literature to be competent to prepare a Telugu
Lexicon and a Telugu Grammar.
   J.C. Morris (1798—1858), a civil servant, mastered Telugu
and served for some time as the Telugu Translator to Government.
His first publication was ‘ Teiugu Selections with Grammatical
Analysis ’ in which he furnished a glossary of revenue teintis used
in the Northern Circars in 1823. He also published an English
Telugu Dictionary on the model of Johnson’s English Dictionary,'
under the auspices of the Board founded for the College and
Public Instruction, and the Government published it in two
volumes in 1835. It was prepared, as he says in the introduction,
‘ not only for the purpose of assisting Europeans in the study of
Telugu but also to aid natives of this country in acquirement of
English       Ravipati Gurumurti Sastri helped him in the compila¬
tion of this Dictionary. Morris was also the Editor of the Madras
Journal of Literature and Science for some years.
   His younger brother, Henry Morris, who served as a Judge in
Godavari District and also as Inspector of Schools for some time,
wrote a * Simplified Grammar ’ in Telugu.
   G. P. Brown’s Telugu—English Dictionary was published in
 1852. He had worked at it for about twenty years during which
period he made a laborious study of the Lexicons published previous
to him, and of the Telugu classics, many of which he published.
Of these some are still known as ‘ Brown’s editions ’. The
Dictionary is very comprehensive; it includes in it words from
classics, praUimdhas as well as satakasy and from popular literature,
and also words in the spoken tongue along with idiomatic expres-
npps. He says:

       * They? arp from ten to twenty quotations from Tejugu
 92                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

      authors in each page. This part of the work w^s executed
      by my own pen; my learned and laborious assistants
      transcribed them for the press but seldom supplied one
      from their own reading .. More than one hundred
      Telugu authors were quoted, every quotation was to be
      verified, transcribed and inserted.. I daily made additions
      in the Dictionaries and Grammar, which are now more
      than doubled.. ’

    C. P. Brown next prtpaied his English-Telugu Dictionary
 with the main object of helping the Telugus to understand and
 translate English books into Telugu. He mentioned the method
 he adopted in explaining the meanings of some difficult English
 words; he says: ‘writing particularly to assist Hindus, I have
 given some minute explanations which Englishmen may deem
 superfluous. But to the Hindu, they are advantageous.*
    The third Dictionary which G. P. Brown published was a
 Dictionary of the Mixed Dialect and foreign words used in Telugu
 (1854). • It was a marvellous and laborious production. As he
 says, * it forms a requisite supplement to a Dictionary of the
 Telugu language; and it contains only those phrases which arc
 current among the natives.’
   Bahujanapalli Sitaramacharyulu’s Telugu Dictionary known
as Sabdaratnakaramu was first published in 1885. In the last part
 of his preface to a subsequent edition of his Dictionary, relating
 to the method of treatment which he adopted, he says that he
included some of the foreign words and some words from Brown’s
Dictionary. Though this dictionary contains many errors and
omissions of several words used by the Telugu poets in the past—
not to speak of the colloquial words used in popular literature,
it may be said that it is still regarded as a standard dictionary.
   Sankara Narayana’s English-Telugu and Telugu-English
Dictionaries, which appeared about the close of the last century,
and the commencement of this century, were mainly Intended
to help students of High Schools and Colleges; they are, therefore,
handy volumes. He received immense help from Brown’i
Dictionaries but criticised the popular language used by Brown
in the sentences explaining the meaning 'of the words. He was
influenced by the pandits who wanted to us<^ ‘ chaste ’ language,
bv which they meant the poetic dialect. Of these two dictionaries.
INFLUBNGE OF WESTERN CULTURE                                     93
his English-Telugu Dictionary has been more popular and has
undergone modifications in subsequent editions. The present
writer revised and enlarged it in 1926 and it was subsequently
(in 1953) further revbed and enlarged by the late lamented
Dr. C. Narayana Rao.
   A subsequent Telugu Dictionary worth mentioning is Andhra
Vachaspatyarm by Kotra Syama Sastri. It contains 1840 pages
and was published in parts during 1910—1940. A special feature
of the dictionary is that it groups all the synonyms of several
words (both Sanskrit and Telugu) undci- one of tliem and enume¬
rates all the details of a subject under some heads. For example,
under Svaramu (voice, note, tunc) 9 columns are devoted to details
of the several kinds of svarams. Thus we find in it not merely a
dictionary in the ordinary sense of the word but also a book of
knowledge. It cannot be denied that it is found very useful as
a book of reference. There are however many errors—almost
the same as are found in Sabdaratnakaram. The author is the son
of Lakshminarayana who had previously published a dictionary
of ‘ pure ’ Telugu words (excluding Sanskrit words, though
in use in Telugu speech and literature) and in the preparation
of that work, the son was the father’s collaborator.
   Suryarayandhra Kighaniuvu is a voluminous Lexicon undertaken
by Sri Ravu Suryarao, the Mahara,ja of Pithapuram who opened at
his expense an office known as the Lexicon office in 1916 and
appointed an editor and scholars to assist him. It has passed
through several hands—four or five editors, who died one after
another, and several scholars. I’he first volume w'as published
in 1938 under the editorship of Jayanti Ramayya Pantulu who
had studied Lexicography and followed the essential features
illustrated in Brown’s Telugu-English Dictionary. But, as a
result of his discussions with the Lexicon pandits, he disregarded
the really useful principles adopted by Brown. He and his
pandits and the Maharaja were all purists in the matter of language;
they were keen on maiutajiiing the ‘purity’ of the language
in explaining the meanings of words. They rigorously excluded
words not used by the poets of the past and also words of recent
origin though used by contemporary poets and writers of eminence,
like Viresalingam Pantulu, Ghellapilla Venkata Sastri, the first
Telugu poet-laureate, and his successor Sripada Krishnamurti
Sastri. This was done, even though the editors of the Lexicon
94                                HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

had accepted the authority of Brown’s Dictionary in the case of
many words. A lengthy review of this first volume hy G. V. Ilam^-
murti was published in 1939, in the course of which he pointed
out several errors, and omission of some important words. Subse¬
quently, under the editorship of Kasibhatla Subbaya Sastri,
three more volumes of this huge Lexicon were published by 1943;
but the work dragged on till 1949 and the Maharaja of Pithapur
closed the Lexicon Office and entrusted the work of publishing
the last three volumes to the present writer. Progress in printing
them was unfortunately interrupted by financial stringency due
to the abolition of the Zamindaris. The present writer had then
to apply to the Government for financial aid, with the approval
of the Maharaja. This was made available in 1957. The fifth
and sixth volumes have been published and about 670 pages of
the seventh (and the last volume) have been printed, and in the
course of a few months, it will also be published.^ This huge
Lexicon may have many errors and omissions, but it is certainly
a very comprehensive Dictionary with several shades of meanings
of words, and quotations from standard works in the case of
thousands of words.
   Vavilla’s Telugu Dictionary stopped with the third volume
and the fourth has to commence with words beginning with the
letter * pa ’ exactly where the fifth volume of the Suryarayandhra
Nighantutuvu had to begin. It must be said in fairness to the
Vavilla Dictionary that the authors, Sripada Lakshmipati Sastri
and Bulusu Venkatcswarlu improved upon Suryarayandhra
Nighantutuvu which they followed in several places, by adding
some words left out in it and citing fresh quotations from the
classics.
   For the progress of Lexicography in Telugu, the work started
by the Western scholars—^particularly G. P. Brown—^was the source
of inspiration for the Telugu Lexicographers in the matter of
technique and execution.
   A. Galletti’s Telugu Dictionary printed at the Oxford University
Press in 1935 is the latest work in the field of Lexicography by
Western scholars. It opens with a photo of the Ra^a of Bobbili
who was the chief patron of this Dictionary, and to whom it was
dedicated with the words

        * Trusting that this Dictionary of cuiftent Telugu will
V    1 Since published, in 1965
INFLUENCE OP WEStERN CULTURE                                        95
     conduce to the diffusion of knowledge, I lay it at the feet
     of the Honourable the Raja of Bobbili, Chief Minister *.

    In his preface, the author says: ‘ I have for one thing used
 Roman characters and for another left out all words that are
 not in common use. I do not conceal from myself that a common
 verdict of the Telugus will be “ Idi ye dieshanari? dieshanari
gieshanari; that is, this is no dictionary at all. It is perfectly
 true that it is not a dictionary in the ordinary sense, but rather
 a manual for young people learning Telugu or English, and it
 aims at educating, edifying, or even amusing them when they
 look up words.’
    His son, R. Galletti, for whom this dictionary was planned,
wrote a masterly introduction to it, and he could anticipate the
 events to come. He writes in the Introduction, ‘ Since English
is now the language of the administration, the Courts, and the
 Colleges—^in short, of every manifestation of the new activity—the
vernacular naturally enriches itself from the English. But should
the period of English dominance end tomorrow and the Andhras
form their own government, they must make an attempt to conduct
their own affairs in their own language.’            Referring to the
controversy between classical and modem Telugu he says: ‘ A
reconciliation is to be effected by discarding obselete doctrine
and examining the speech of educated men all over the Andhra
country, to see what usages are admissible and what must be
regarded as solecisms. So may be compiled a Dictionary of
modern Telugu usage which will do for grammar what this work
attempts for vocabulary, establishing a norm and encouraging
the men of genius to use the tools most fitted for their work.
Perhaps inspiration will be lacking while the Telugu nation is
in tutelage; but when the notable and puissant nation renews its
mighty youth, when the full tide of inspiration begins to flood the
land, it is surely the common people, the people of the villages,
who should hear and applaud. It is their language that must be
used; therefore to its study this work is devoted.’
   It is indeed a very useful dictionary of the current language.
There are many idiomatic expressions and proverbs to illustrate
the use of several words. It may be regarded as a dictionary
which illustrates the usage of current Telugu in the northern
dbtricts of the coastal area. But in spite of all its merits it has not
  96                                  HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

    been widely used in the country, mainly because it is published
   in Roman characters with which the people in ^neral are not
   familiar and also because the price is prohibitive.
      The work relating to Telugu Grammar is another great service
   rendered by the Western scholars to the progress of Telugu
   language and literature.
      I have already referred to the earliest Gentoo (Telugu) grammar
   by a Frenchman, condemned by William Brown who published
   his Gentoo (Telugu) Grammar in 1817. Nor was this Grammar
   satisfactory. It must, therefo/'e, be said that the first commendable
   Telugu Grammar was what was prepared by A. D. Campbell in
   1816. The ‘ manuscript ’, as the author says, ‘ was submitted
   to the Government of Fort St. George whose approbation it
  having been so fortunate as to obtain, the copyright was purchased
  on the public account and the Right Honourable the Governor
  in Council was pleased to direct that the work should be printed
  at the College Press whence it now issued to the public ’.
     Francis M. Ellis, who was then Head of the Board of
  Superintendence of the College of Fort St. George, wrote a note
  as a supplement to Campbell’s Introduction to his Grammar..
  This note amplifies what Campbell modestly stated: ‘ Neither
  the Tamil, the Telugu nor any of their cognate dialects arc deriva¬
 tions from the Sanskrit; the latter, however it may contribute
 to their polish, is not necessary for their existence and they form
 a distinct family of languages with which the Sanskrit has, in
 later times especially, intermixed but with which it has no radical
 connection ’. Campbell regards the opinion of Ellis as valuable
 because he says, ‘ The knowledge which this gentleman (Ellis)
 possesses of the various spoken dialects of the Peninsula, added
 to his acquirement as a Sanskrit scholar, peculiarly qualify him
 to pronounce a judgment on the subject.’
     Dr. Caldwell who published his Comparative Grammar of
the Dravidian Languag         ’n 1855—1856, strengthens the view
expressed by Campbell and referring to what the previous scholars
had said, he states with vehemence, ‘ The supposition of the
derivation of the Dravidian languages from Sanskrit, though
entertained by a Colebrook, a Carey and a Wilkins, is now known
to be entirely destitute of foundation.’ (vide p. 45. Second
edition—1875).
INFLUENCE OP WESTERN CULTURE                                       97

    William Brown was no doubt the earliest to point out the
 absurdity of the statement of Dr. Carey (vide W. Brown’s Grammar
 of the Gentoo language, 1817, preface—page xii). He writes—
 ** When the compiler of that small tract (Telugu Grammar by
 Dr. Carey—1814) on another occasion asserts that * the Sanskrit
 is the immediate parent of the"Mahratta, the Orissa, the Telenga,
 the Carnatic, the Gujarat and the Malabar and Tamil languages *
 and that the ‘ knowledge of the Sanskrit places all those in our
 power, as it will generally furnish four words out of five of them *;
 we cannot help smiling at the gross mistake exhibited in a Grammar
 of the Gentoos, compiled as it has been by one (Dr. Carey) who
 is so professedly competent in the Sanskrit language ”.
    As an argument against Dr. Carey’s statement, W. Brown said,
 “ should we, for example, place the words of any sentence in the
 Gentoo and in the Sanskrit together, the contrast between the
 two will appear so very great that it would only tend to involve
 the question in still greater perplexity; but it can scarcely fail to
argue the want of an original and natural connection between
them.”
    Campbell advanced more arguments referring to the declension
of nouns and pronouns, the inclusive plural form, manamu (-you
and I) the conjugation of the affirmative verbs, the existence of a
negative aorist, a negative imperative and their negative forms
in the verb etc., and said that “ they are entirely unconnected
with the Sanskrit; while the Tamil and Karnataka scliolars will
at once recognize their radical connection with each of these
languages ”. Referring to the Sanskrit words introduced into
Telugu he said, “ they are not allowed to retain their original
forms; they undergo changes and assume terminations and inflec¬
tions, unknown to the Sanskrit, and except as foreign quotations
are never admitted into Teloogoo until they appear in the dress
peculiar to the language of the land.”
    Francis W. Ellis not only supported the views expressed by
Campbell but also went further. By that time Pattabhi Rama
Sastri, a pandit of the College, prepared a table of Telugu verbs
{Telugu DhaUimala) illustrating the conjugational forms. ElHs
making use of about forty verbs from this table and forty analogous
verbs from Tamil and Kannada, and similarly some De^a terms
from Venkayya’s Dictionary,'][and Tamil and Kannada terms
expressive of the same ideas, compared them all and showed that
      7
 98                                 HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE


  “ the radicals of these languages, mutaiis mutandis are the same
  and this comparison will show that the native tefms in general
  use in eacli, con'espt'ud          rle further observed “ .... in
  collocation of words, in syntaxical govoniment, in phrase and
  indeed, in all that is comprclunidcd under the term idiom, they
  arc, not similar only but the same/
    C. P. Bro''vn‘'s Tcingu Gramrn.ir was first published in 1840
  and the sccoiid edition appeared in 1837. It excels all the previous
 grammars mentioned above. It scis a model for any su’osequent
 gramme r which may l)c*-pn'parcd on modern lines, and not,
 according to the traditional method obtaining in the country^ from
 the cailii--.t times. Tlic method of wanting .gi'amj/iars in verse and
 in terse rules (,r;//*ap) served their pinposc at a tiine when every
 thing was learnt by rote; and they could r.ol be understood without
 commentaries. The in'lucucc of the Western culture on the
 Tclugu language and literature is best felt in the maUer of the new
 method adopted in pn'paring grammars. G. P. Brown’s Grammar
 as well as his Dictionaiics should be publislied again, as they are
 out c>f print and out of stock, and I feel confident that all of them
 will be a source of inspiration to the young scholars of the present
 and future generations.
    C. P. Brown’s yeoman’s services in the field of Tclugu literature
relate also to the improvement of the printing press and editing
 and publishing Telugu classics with notes, glossaries and commen¬
 taries prepared by eminent scholars of his time. But for his
 services, many valuable books which were in his time in the stage
of manuscripts—already worn out and rotten—might not have
seen the light of the day. “ The ancient Telugu classics ”, he
says, “ were in a deplorable state like that of Greek and Latin
authors before the invention of printing              Referring to the
state of affairs in the matter of Telugu literature he says, “ when
 I began these tasks Telugu literal ure was dying out, the flame was
just glimmering in the socket ” and referring to the miserable
condition of the Telugu pandits of his time, he says “ The pandits
expressed to me their grief, that the ruling powers regarded them
as useless pensioners        He clearly stated, “ To benefit the Hindus
was always my primary object. He condemned the method of
study adopted by the Pandits and suggested the Western method.
He states, “ Were we to submit entirely to their guidance, we
should learn little that is profitable. They Exhort us to learn by

preferring the European method of study        He explained the
mediod ho :idopicd for editing classics in Tclugu: “ I first had

preparing the notes and cotnjucji'nies to books that cannot be
easily understood by the ordiiuivy .students. Cl, P. Brown adopted
a method which is w<^)rlhy of ii -ilowijig. lii his introduction to
 Vasuchariira he says that hi.s notes are ‘ intended to explain the
text, word by word, in the clearest manner, so as to do away with
the necessity of oral instruction ’. Zuluru Aj)payya was the
pandit who prejjared the commentary for Vasucharitra. He was
one of the best pandits employed by Browm.
   Brown encouraged the pandits to write the commentaries in
the spoken language in which they orally rendered tiic meaning
of the verse to the listeners. He discouraged the vainglorious
exhibition of scholarship in the commentaries written by some
pandits, and encouraged the commentaries which could be useful
to the learner.
   Browm’s edition of Vcmana’s Satakam is marvellous. Tie was
very fond of tljp verses, mainly because they contained aphorisms
in simple language and their import would increase with the
mental development of the reader. Browm published Vemana
Satakam with his English translation in 1829. In the preface he
described how he got the manuscripts, classified tlie verses and
edited them. ‘ After collecting such copies as were to be found
100                                 HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

 at Masulipatam where I was then stationed, I ggpidually procured
 others from Vizagapatam, Nellore, Guntur, Cuddapah and
 Madras .... I at length formed the whole into five tolerably
 consistent divisions—religious, moral, satirical, mystic and
miscellaneous ’.
    Another important service rendered by C. P. Brown relates to
his translation of the Gospel of Luke in 1832 under the caption
of Luka Suvarta into Telugu prose and this was rendered into
Tclugu verse by a              (a Saivite) poet. Brown wrote also
 the Telugu reader, being a series of letters, private and on
business, police and revenue matters, with an English translation,
notes explaining the grammar, and a little lexicon in three parts.
It was printed and published in 1851-1852 by the S.P.C.K. Press,
Vepery, Madras. His Vakyavali containing exercises in idioms,
English and Telugu, was also printed and published by the
S.P.C.K. Press in 1852.
   I may add that foreign scholars like G. P. Brown and Caldwell
admired the mellilluousness of the language and called it the
• Italian of the East ’.
   The Christian Missionaries commenced to write books on the
Christian faith in the early years of the 17th century. RolDcrt
de Nobili, an Italian Padre (of the Madurai Mission) wore the
robes of an Indian ascetic, styled himself as Jagadgtmi and went
about preaching the Christian faith. He was well versed in
Tamil, Telugu and Sanskrit.
   Benjamin Schultze, a German Missionary, acquired a good
knowledge of Telugu and wrote an epitome of spiritual instruction
in the Holy Bible {Satyamaina Vedamlo vunde jnana vupadesala yokka’
samkshepam). It was printed in 1746 at Halae Magdeburgicae,
Gemiany. Another book of his was first translated by P. Malai-
yappan from the German into Tamil under the caption Mum
Karyangal and it was translated into Telugu under the caption
of Buddhi (sic) Kaligina .. nuru jnana vachanala yokka chinna pustakam.
It was also printed and published at Halae Magdeburgicae.
   The Holy Bible, containing the Old and New‘Testaments was
translated from the originals into the Telinga (Telugu) language,
by the Serampore Missionaries: (vol. V. containing the New
Testament Isvaruni anni matalu .. ide dharma pustakam pp. 940,
Mission Press, Serampore, 1818).

     nimayamai ymnadi       (British and Foreign Bible Society,

  . Parts of the Gospels were also published separately by several
 authors and they were printed at several presses. Under the
 caption of the Telugu words in Tehjgu ^characters, Devmi Tokka

yesu kristu yokka subha iamacharamu (The gospels according to
 Mathew, Mark and Luke, Translated by Augustus Des Granges

 rayar, Serampore, 1812).
    The Gospel of Mark (Marku cheta vrayabadina Sabhavartamanamu)
 was published by the committee founded in 1835 (pp. 64, Madras
 Auxiliary Bilde Society, Mission Press, Bellary, 1840).
    Of the Old Testament, Pentateuch (Dharma pustaka .. isvarudu
ye samasta vakyamulanu prakasamu chestunnado d vakyamulu) was
 translated into Telugu by the Serampore Missionaries, viz.
W. Carey, J. Masshman and W. Ward, (pp. 632, Serampore,
 1821).
    The Book of Exodus was translated into Telugu and published
by a committee founded in 1835 which made use of the papers
of Pritchett and Gordon. It was printed at the Mission Press,
Bellary, in 1844.
    Hundreds of such books have been translated into Telugu and
published at Serampore, Bellary, Madras, Vizagapatam and
other places.
    The services rendered by Colonel Colin Mackenzie (1753—1821)
to Telugu literature and history are highly commendable. He
had the assistance of Kavali Venkata Borraiah (1776—1803)
a resident of Eluru (West Godavari District) for whom he had
high regard. He says, ‘ The connection then formed (in 1796)
with one pdbon, a native and a Brahmin (the lamented
V. G. Borriah then almost a youth of the quickest genius) was the
first step of my introduction into the portal of Indian knowledge.
He collected cart-loads of material—1568 books relating to Telugu,
Sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Oriya, Maharashtra,

Hindi, Parsi, Arabic and Burmese languages; 2070 local records,
8076 inscriptions, 6218 coins, 79 illustrations of old buildings,
2630 pictures of sculpture etc., 106 idols, statues, etc., and 40
relics of old ruins   (Vide—A Descriptive catalogue of Mackenzie
collections with Life, 2ncl edition, Madras. 1882). The Govern¬
ment of India purchased the malctials he had collected from his
wife after his death for £l0,000j- Those that related to South
India were prescnlcd in 1828 to tlie then iy.Iadras College Library.
In 1836 the Rev. William Taylor who was appointed to examine
and classify them preparai a descriptive catalogue of about
570 pages. C. P. Brown noticed that many papers of Mackenzie’s
collections wtne worn out; he got them rewritten on good and
durable paper. There were C2 voliunes relating to local history
and about 45 of them belonged to 'IVIugu districts. Mackenzie
may be regarded as the lirst Westt'.n scholar who laid the founda¬
tion for research work in our country, atid ills assistcuU was fsorr.iiah,
a Telugu of Eluru.
    The Telugu used in the various versir)ns of the Bildc, in the
Grammars of Campbell and Brown, and in the Dictionaries from
W. Brown’s to C. P. Brown’s and in the commentaries of the
 classics, was the popular language and not the arlificial classical
 language. This was in consonance with the trp.dition of writing
 prose as well as commentaries in popular Telugu, commencing
 with the prose writers at Madurai.
    A. H. Arden follow^ed the same rnctliod in his ‘ A Progressive
 Grammar of the Telugu language with copious examples and
 Exercises, etc.’ (1873) and in his ‘ A Companion Telugu
 Reader’ to his Grammar (1879).
    The liberal minded pandits made a line use of the colloquial
 dialect in their prose composilion.s, but never cared to include
 the popular forms in their rules of grammar. As Campbell
 observed they considered them vulgar and beneath the notice of
 the learned. But there were pandits like Ravipati Gurumurti
 Sastri who did not neglect the colloc[uial dialect in illustrating
 the grammatical forms. Gurumurti Sastri made a free use of the
 polished spoken forms not only in his stoiy books, viz. Vikra~
 ynatkunikathalu (1819), Panchatmtra, (1834) etc., but also in his
  Telugu                 grammar of classical Telugu (1836).
    We shall see in a subsequent section how this healthy tradition
 of writing Telugu prose in an elevated colloquial dialect, which
INFLUENCE OF WESTERN CULTURE                                        103

 commenced in the last years of the 17th century and was supported
 by the Western scholars, like G. P. Brown, received a rude shock
 from Chinnaya Suri and his followers after G. P. Browii left the
 country.
    More important than the services rendered by the Christian
 Missionaries who published the Telugu versions of their Holy
 Bible and by eminent scholars like Campbell, Ellis, G. P. Brown
 and Caldwell who published their Grammars and Dictionaries
 etc., was the English education which steadily spread in the country
 and led to the rapid growth of Indiari*lit(flratures. Telugu literature
 like the other Indian literatures, progressed both in matter and
 method of treatment. It was enriched with a wider knowledge
 and found adequate scope for expression through several patterns
 of production.
    The I'clugu children, like children in oiher parts of India
 received Engiisb cdiu ation through two agencies; the Christian
 Missionaries and the Government—the former being the earlier
of the two.
    So early as 1606, the Madurai Mission was founded by Robert
de Nobili who worked among the Tclugus of the Tafijorc and
 Madurai kingdoms. I.atcr on, the Carnalic Mission commenced
its activities south of the Krislina river in the early years of the
 18th century. As a result of their activities, Pingali Ellanarya
of Guntur district wrote a poem of four cantos, known as Tobhya-
charitra and also as Sarveswara Mabatmyam. He probably wrote
for money and satisfied his conscience by giving it a second name,
as he was not a Christian but a SaivUc. It gives an account of
the life of St. Thomas.
    Mangalagiri Aiiandakavi of Guntur district, a Xiyogi B^dimin,
embraced Christianily and v/rote Vedanta Rasnyanain as a poem
of four raiitos, a few years after 1750. It related to the I: ' rnid
Teachings of Jesv.s Christ.
   In 180'K the T.ondon Mission Society 'vas founded in Visakha-
patnam. The Rev. George Gran and the Rev. George Das
Grangc;s connected with that society, first learnt Iclugu anfl then
translatetl the Ciospels in 1812. This Mission also started schools,
and children of all communities without distinction of caste,
colour or creed, were admitted and thus a step in social refonn
was taken in that town.
 104                              HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

    During the first two quarters of the 19th century, the Bellary
 Tract Society was very active in publishing many flracts to spread
  the Christian faith among the Telugus—young and old—in
  1835 and 1838. They were edited^'and partly composed by
 John Reid. Of these tracts No. 22 is Catechetical 'instruction
 for young children {Chinnavaru ' telusukomtagina prasnottaramula
 bodhana).
    About the same time, in 1836, the Godavari Delta Mission was
 formed and Sir Arthur Cotton requested Missionaries there to
 preach the Gospels among the workers 'then engaged in the
 construction of the dam across the Godavari at Dhavaleswaram,
 near Rajahmundry.
    The American Baptist Mission working at Nellore, Ongolc,
 Kurnool and Hyderabad established hospitals and schools at
 several places in these towns. Eminent Cambridge scholars like
 Noble and Fox came from England in 1841 and established a
 Church of the C.M.S. in Masulipatam. The educational institu¬
 tions which they established—particularly the Noble College at
 Masulipatam—^spread English education in that part of the Telugu
 country. ' Dr. E. Prakasam says in his article on ‘ The Origin
 and Progress of the Christian Chin ch in Andhra Desa ’ published
in the Christmas Supplement of the Madras Mail in 1949, ‘ The
 Noble College produced many graduates including the first two
lady graduates of India, Kamalamma and Sundaramma, daughters
of Sivarama Krishnamma, a Brahmin convert ’.
    Heyer, a priest from Germany, came to Guntur in 1842, and
opened a school for children, and later on a college was opened
which is now known as the Andhra Christian College. Similarly
schools were opened at Nandyal and Kurnool by the Society for
the propagation of the Gospels. The Canadian Baptist Mission
came to the Telugu country in 1867 and started schools at
several places including Visakhapatnam and Kakinada. The
American Lutheran Church Mission also established several
schools in other places. Though very few people could be
converted to Christianity by the activities of these Christian
Missionary Bodies, it must be admitted that the outlook of the
Telugus was widened, and that through the study of English
literature at school and college, Telugu literature was enriched
by the Telugu writers who were influenced bjr Western culture.
INFLUENCE OF WESTERN CULTURE                                       105

  Education for Telugu girls was also provided by the Missionary
bodies at many places.

       Education in Government Schools and Colleges


    The East India Company were first interested in starting schools
 primarily to get educated persons to serve in their offices. When
 they established the College in Fort St. George in 1812, their chief
 motive was to give the civilian officers instruction in the South
 Indian languages of the province c»f Madras. So far as Telugu
was concerned, scholars like Vedam Pattabhirama Sastri and
 Ravipati Gurumurti Sastri were appointed to teach Telugu.
 A School Book Society was also established in 1819, which continued
 its work till 1854 and published many books to promote the
development of vernacular literature. The college rendered
 great service to the cause of education and the progress of literature
and linguistic studies.      Many books were purchased by the
Government, as was mentioned in the previous pages, through
 the recommendation of this college.
    Thomas Munro, during the period he was Governor of Madras
 (1820—27), enquired into the state of education among the people
in the province of Madras and organised schools in all the places
which were the headquarters of the Tahsildars and District
 Collectors. In his ‘ Minute on Education* dated 10th March
 1826, he stated: ‘Whatever expense Government may incur
% the education of the people will be amply repaid by the improve¬
ment of the country, for the general diffusion of knowledge is
inseparably followed by a taste for the comforts of life, by exertion
to acquire them and by growing prosperity of the people *•
Through his efforts a committee of Public Instruction was organised
for the spread of education in the province.
    Subsequently, the Minute of Lord Macaulay on Education
recommending English Education to promote the study of Western
culture—Humanities and Sciences—came up for discussion.
Several Indians were opposed to the recommendations made by
Lord Macaulay, but there were others like Raja Ram Mohan
Roy w'ho supported it; and finally, the Government of India
decided on the 7th March 1835 in favour of Lord Macaulay’s
recommendation.
   The ol>ject of the Government was not to suppress the study
 106                                   HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE'

 of the vernaculars and on the contrary they desired to import into
 the vernacular literatures whatever was best in western culture.
 But this could be done only by Indian scholars who accjuired an
 adequate knowledge of English to understand books in English,
 besides a high degree of pioftcicncy in their mother-tongue to
 enable them to translate Enolish books into it.        The Government
 expected a diffusion of modern knowledge among the masses,
 through scholars who acquired English education.              With this
 object in view, provision was made in schools and colleges for
 translation from and into Enj«Iish, and for the award of an annual
 prize for the best exposition of a selected book in English by a
 standard author. But the object was not realised because the
scholars, while they acquired an adequate knowledge of English,
could not express (I’cmselves in thr ir own moiher-tojiguc.        While
it was comparatively easier to larldo riiiglish books relating to the
Humanities, it was very dilhcult—almost impossible—to trans¬
late books on science.       This unratisfaciory state of things could
easily be accounted for.     To some extent it must be admitted that
the Indian schokus neglected the study of their mother-tongue
and devoted more attention to the study of English.         But it must
also be admitted that neither Teliigu nor any other Indian
language possessed the reepusite vocabulary to express modern
scientific ideas.   The country is confronted with this problem
even now.     So far as Tclugu is concerned, the question is:        “ Is
Telugu rich enough to replace English as the ohicial language of
the State and to be the medium of instruction iji the University?
  An extract from       R.    Gallctti’s introduction   to his   father’s
(A. Galletti’s) Tciugu Dietioi’aiy is worth quoting in this connec¬
tion: “ Now it rn; y be a pity, but it is a fact, that on nearly all
matters except thf>se of domestic and personal concern the educated
Telugu learns to tlunk and to express himself not in Telugu but
,n English.   The abstiaet terms which he can readily handle are
English.   Whether lie is talking of politics, or economics, or
medicine, or agiicnltural science, or law, or education, the odds
are that he has im Id lied his information in Englisli, that his concepts
are founded on the English words, and that he could express
himself with greater accuracy, fluency, and force in English than
in the vernacular. This state of affairs, be its causes and its
defects what they may, has a curious dominant^ in modern Telugu.
It brings it about that a writer, so soon as he learns thejspheres in
INFLUENCE OF WESTERN CULTURE                                      107

which he is accustomed to use the vernacular as his daily medium
of expression, begins as it were to translate      his thoughts into
I’clugu rather than to compose in Telugu.         All who have had
occasion to study the official translations of Government publica¬
tions and of Acts of the Legislature will know the consequence
that generally follows; the language is thrown out of its stride and
becomes a curious hybrid, with no style of any kind.      Just as the
English school-boy writes dog-Latin in trying to put English into
Latin without reconstructing the meaning in a Latin form, so
does the Telugu graclnaie write dbg-'iclngu because his thought
was born in English and resists transmigration.       When he tries
to reincarnate it in a language not even his own, that is in the
Sanskritised obsolescent dialect of tlie pandits, the infant becomes
a monster.    Nobody who knows E!igiish at all wall ever make
use of rhe versions prepared by Government translators—better
a foreign language than a clk'oriion of language. ’
  It is bad logic to say that Erigli.h education \vas responsible for
this unfortunate state of afTaij ;.   l?ut for the English education,
the country would have becti in blissful ignorance of modern
culture.   The only remedy for it lies in developing a healthy
prose on the lines set by the prostr writer^ at Madurai, and on the
lines followed by Brown and the pandiis trahied by him, and by
encouraging a free use of the foreign words along with the ideas
which they represent.
  In the subsequent sections T shall review the ^vork of Ghinnaya
Siiri (1806—1862) who set back the progre^.s of the \vork done
by the Vvcsteni scholars, and the work ofK. Vivesalingam Pantiilu
(1847—1919) wlio effected a compromise and proved to be a
precursor of modern literature in Toiugii.
                         CHAPTER VIII

      Paravastu Chinnaya Sun (1806—1862) and
                    His Followers

    Pandits who had been brought up in the tradition of the past
 had regard only for poetic por^positions and for grammars based
 on the poems of the eminent poets of the past. They were not in
 favour of the prose works produced at Madurai and the popular
 forms used in them. The literary work of the foreigners, the
 steady progress made by the Christian Missionaries, the literature
 produced by them to spread their faith among the people, and the
school books introduced in the schools were all bewildering to the
pandits. But they could not loudly protest against this course of
 progress in the country because it was all supported by the
Government. They were only waiting for an opportunity to
ventilate their resentment; and the opportunity came when
C. P. Brown published his edition of Vemana’s poems with an
English translation in which there were verses satirizing Brah¬
mans. They protested against the publication of such books,
and, in response to their protest, the College Board stopped the
sale and circulation of the printed copies of this book. But
Brown, who came to know of this suppression ten years later,
secured a reversal of the order.
    Paravastu Chinnaya Suri disliked the literary work of the
foreigners and was not in favour of the prose works which were
teeming with popular forms; but he could not openly condemn
them, because they had the support of the Government. He
became a pandit of the Presidency College, Madras, and through
his influence with the Government, he succeeded in introducing
the kavya style even for prose writing in schools and colleges,
from the earliest stage of education in the primary schools.
   Chinnaya Suri was a great pandit. He wrote several works
relating to Telugu grammar: a commentary on Andhra Sabda
Chintamani composed in Sanskrit, a grammar in Telugu verse,
Andhra Sabdanusasanam and Balaryakaranam. But except the last,
the other books were not published. The Sahitya Parishat at
                               108
 PARAVASTU CHINNAYA SURl                                         109

  Kakinada obtained a manuscript copy of his Telugu Dictionary
  (not published) and made use of it in preparing the Suryara-
yandhra Nighantuvu. He composed two books in prose: Mitra-
 bheda and Mitra labha under the caption of MHchandrika (1853^
  1st edition). They were composed in an artificial rhythmic
 prose, teeming with stylistic ornaments—artkalankara and sabda-
 lankara. The jingling sentences with sonorous expressions
 contribute to the melody of the language. It contains a rich
 vocabulary for the patient study of the teacher and the taught,
 and though considering the size o# each book, they could be read
 through in a few hours, it could take several months to be studied
 in the school room, because almost every sentence contains words
 which the students cannot readily understand without reference
 to a dictionary or an explanation from the pandit. Such is the
 piece of literature that was produced by Chinnaya Suri after a
 prodigious effort for several years. Since then, and to this day,
 either of these books has been prescribed for the High School
students of Forms IV, V and VI, because it contains rich material
for study—not so much in thought as in words and phrases! Many
subsequent writers of Telugu prose were so enamoured of its style
that they imitated it. Even Viresalingam Pantulu imitated it
and went a step further in making the language still more difficult
for the student, when he composed the third book of the Panchatantra,
known as Vigrahatantra. But later on, he changed his style and
wrote the Sandhitantra in easy prose. Chinnaya Suri’s Nitichandrika
contains, however, some expressions which according to the rules
of grammar previous to him or the usage of eminent poets accepted
as authoritative by him, should be regarded as errors.
    His epitome of Hindu Dharma Sadr a was composed in an easier
style. It contains a few expressions which according to his own
grammar must be regarded as errors.
   His Balavyakaranam has been recognised by almost all pandits
as a standard Telugu Grammar. Conventional terms like Lit^
Lat, Lung, etc., borrowed from Sanskrit grammars were used in
his rules^ (sutras) and the precept ‘ the shorter the better ’ was
observed in framing very terse sutras. Authorities from the Kavyas
were not quoted in support of his rules. Some rules were based
on the usage of the first known poet Nannaya only, and some on
that of later poets. Some forms used by eminent poets were
condemned as wrong and on account of some omissions or mistakes
110                                 HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

in his grammar, the usage of even eminent poets like Tikkana
had to be regarded as wrong. And, instead of supporting the
usage of poets and the need for revising the sutras of Chinnaya Suri,
scholars chose to correct the text of the classics while printing
the later editions, on the authority of Chinnaya Suri’s grammar,
not realising that it would be like puAing the cart before the horse.
  An elaborate account of Chinnaya Suri’s work is presented here,
because his infiuence on later writers, for more than sixty years,
was unassailable and he was responsible for the development of
an artificial prose, arresting t^ie progress of healthy prose in Teliigu
that had been developing up to his time.

      The Age of Rao Bahadur        K.   Viresalinoam Pantulu
                            (1G47—1919)


   A short resume of the deep-rooted literaiy traditions that
controlled the Telugu scholars and poets is not out of place here,
particularly because Viresalingam Pantulu was brought up in
them though, through courage of conviction, he gradually trans¬
gressed them to a large extent. He had already been able to
discard the more oppressive social traditions and proved to be
the first practical social reformer among the Telugus.
   Telugu scholars and poets of this age had the greatest respect
for poetic compositions—particularly Prabandhas—and very slight
regard for prose. They had every respect for grammars and the
usage of eminent poets of the past and in this matter also, they had
the principle of ‘ the earlier, the better      in determining the
authority. This was in consonance with the prevailing notions of
authority in our country—generally among the people and,
particularly among the orthodox scholars. While the 'western
people hold the view of * the more recent,' the greater the
authority * the Indians hold the view of * the more ancient, the
greater the authority ’.
   There had developed, however, a few patterns of Telugu literature
like Satakasj Takshagamsy songs, prose works etc., prior to the time
of Viresalingam Pantulu; and foreign scholars produced grammars,
dictionaries and prose works. But they did not appeal to the
orthodox pandits, nor were they regarded as particularly important
for the development of Telugu literature.
   Chinnaya Suri strengthened the literary tra^tiom and made
PARAVASTU CHINNAYA SUM                                             111
  them more rigid. It almost looked as if he and his followers
 sought deliberately to undo the work of the foreign scholars.
     We shall now see how Viresalingam Pantulu brought up in
 these literary traditions gradually transcended them and proved
 to be the precursor of modern literature in Telugu.
     Viresalingam Pantulu started his literary career as an ordinary
 pandit. Leading a simple frugal life, he applied himself with
 extraordinary diligence to his studies, and acquired an all-round
 knowledge, refinement, and culture. He passed the Matriculation
 examination in 1870, but being unable        continue his studies he
 worked as a teacher on a monthly salary of twenty five rupees.
 In 1874 he organised a school for girls at Dhavalesvaram, at a
 time when education for women was not deemed to be necessary.
 In 1876 he launched two journals, viz., Vivekavardhani and Ha^a
 Sanjivini, the former of which published articles of literary interest
 as well as the unpublished works of the poets of the previous
 generation in parts, and the second was intended to dispel super¬
 stitious beliefs and fears by ridiculing persons who entertained
 them. In 1885 he started another journal known as Satihita
 Bodhinij meant mainly for educating women and widening their
outlook on life. As a teacher he was not of the type of an ordinary
 pedagogue. He taught his pupils self-reliance and the value of
social service.
    There were at that time many social evils which had to be
eradicated, such as early marriages, marriages of very old men
with very young girls, bride’s price, the prostitution of dancing-
girls, want of education among women, corruption among officials,
drink, beliefs in ghosts and witchcraft, and untouchability—all
of which hindered the growth of a healthy cultured society,
Viresalingam Pantulu endeavoured to combat these social evils
through his writings. He trained a band of workers to organise
meetings and deliver speeches.
    Brought up in the prevailing literary traditions of the age, he
followed the standard set by Ghinnaya Suri and wrote his
 Vigrahatantramu in ornate prose even more difficult than that of
Ghinnaya * Suri’s Mtkfutrdrika. He also indulged in literary
acrobatics by writing a poem in the so-called * pure ’ Telu^
without any prose passagejpnd excluding the use of labial sounds.
He did tins to produce         impression among his fellow pandits
that he too was capable of writing * scholarly ’ poetry. But
 112                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LUTRI^TUR^

 later on, he realised that it was all a waste of effort and served no
 useful purpose. When he commenced writing his SarM Tantra
 he wanted to do it in simple prose and gave expression to the
 object he had in his mind.
    He was a prolific and versatile writer. There is hardly any
 branch of literature to which he ha^ not contributed; and whatever
 he wrote, whether it was an essay or a farce or a short poem, or
 a novel or a poem of the Prahandha type, or a drama or anything
 else, was read with an abiding interest by the public—young or
 old. He was neither an eminent Sanskrit scholar of the type of
 Sishtu Krishnamurti Sastri or Vedam Venkataraya Sastri nor a
 brilliant poet like Kuchimanchi Timma Kavi or Ghellapilla
 Venkata Sastri, the first Telugu poet-laureate. In this connection
 I should like to refer to an incident of 1897, which I hope will
 give an insight into the dispositions of some poets of the time and
 may interest my readers. Matsa Venkata Kavi, the Telugu
pandit of the Raja’s College at Parlakimidi, where I was then a
student of Form III, showed us a letter from Vaddadi Subbarayudu
in which it was stated that there had been a conference of pandita
and poets at which it was declared that Mandapaka Parvatisvara
Sastri was the best Telugu poet and that Matsa Venkata Kavi
was the next best, and with an air of self-complacancy and derision
Venkata Kavi said that ViresaHngam Pantulu was recognised
only as one of the best pandits and not poets.
   Whatever be the opinion about Viresalingam Pantulu’s greatness
as a poet or as a pandit among his contemporaries, the consensus
of well considered opinion at present is that he was the precursor
of a new age in Telugu literature. According to his own statement
in his auto-biog^aphy, he was the first novelist, the first essayist,
the first play-wright to write an original drama or a farce, the
first to write on subjects of science, the first to compose short poenu^
the first to write an auto-biography, and the first to write a.
comprehensive * Lives of Telugu Poets ’. He struck new paths-
and his writing led to the new trends in present day Telugu
Literature. This was the result of his imtnbing the essence of
western culture. He read the best books in English literature, and
endeavoured to adopt new patterns of writing.                           .

 bis style propriety of thought and propriety of diction which
 Macaulay says,      are conunonly found together ” in good boohs
 and we do not find anywhere in his writings “obsoirity and
 afiBsetation which according to Macaulay, “ are the two greatest
 faults of style     From a heap of specimens of Telugu prose, we
 can easily tell which of them could be Viresalingam’s even without
 looking at the name of the author. He was a source cd* inspiraticMr
 fisr contemporary and later writers.
    Viresalingam Pantulu knew very well that the spoken word
 was more vigorous and more efifeedve^than the archaic literary
 dialect, and used it for his farces which were intended to expose
 the prevailing evils in the social life of his age. But he did not
 use it for his essays or dramas, lest he might fidl in the estimation
 of contemporary pandits. He did not study the growth of Telugu
lai^^ge, nor was he a student of philology. He, therefore, fint
opposed the modem Telugu movement. But how long could
the ardent social refiarmer stifle the inner urge for reform in
language as well? A healthy mind cannot afford to be liberal
in one field and conservative in another in the coiuse of a consistent
and wholesome cultured life. In 1916, Vir^aJingam happened
to listen to the speech of Gidugu Venkata Ramamurti, the sponsor
of the modem Telugu movement, at Kowur near Rajahmundry.
He then realised that the movement was baaed on sound principles
of language, and though by that time his health was raiAyer
indifferent and he was too old to carry on his literary wmrk with
vigour, he thought of writing a standard modem Teli^ grammar
with the help of Ramamurti^s collectiiMi of materials on thaU;
subject. In 1919 a society was formed to promote modem Teiuga
literature and Viresalingam Pantulu was the president of timt
society. Unfortunately he passed away within a few months,
and Ramamurti had to carry on his work without Viresaliaigam^s
co*op«ratioa or guidance.
    Viresalingam Pantulu's works, which were more thjm one
hundred, ware puhhshed in ten volumes, arranged according to
subjects like poetry, stories and noveb, forces, chamas, essBcy^
Uvea of Telugu poets, etc* Of these books his translatian of
Kalidasa’s              SakunttUm ii still die best though more tfout

the first novel in Telugu and, though based on the story of Gold^

 smith’s Vicar of Wakefield, it reads like a story of the Tclugu
 people. His Satyaraja’s new travels based on Swift’s Gulliver’s
 Travels reads like original fiction and is as humorous and interesting
 as Swift’s work. His drama, Harischandra Natakam is an original*
 work of art, the first original drama of the modern type in Telugu
 Literature. Such of His essays and farces as had a local and
 contemporary interest arc not now widely read, as the themes
 are now out of date but they are still consulted for inspiration and
 guidance by modern writers. The influence of Viresalingam’s
 works is still manifest either directly or indirectly in the literature
 of the present day.

                    Other Poets of this Period


     Before I proceed to the next section—the Modem Telugu
  movement—I shall briefly refer to some other poets of the Age of
  Vircsalingam Pantulu who were wedded to the time-honoured
  literary traditions throughout their literary career.
     An eminent scholar and poet who was a contemporary of
  Vircsalingam Pantulu for a long period was Mandapaka
  Parvatisvara Sastri (1833—1897) whom we noticed under Sataka
  Literature. Besides Satakas, he composed lengthy malikas^ that
  is ordinary vrilia metres with more than the usual number of four
  lines running to 32 or 40 lines with the same rhyming second
  syllable of each line. His translation of the Sanskrit poem
  Amandcamu into Telugu verse was faithful to the original. His
  kavyas like Kanchimahatmyam and Sri Radhakrishna Samavadam are
  written in a scholarly and dignified style.
     Korada Ramachandra Sastri (1816—1900) was a great Sanskrit
  poet first and a Telugu poet next. He was fond of literary
  acrobatic feats and was a good sport in Uterary contests with
 rival pandits. His Rathanga duia in Telugu prose exhibits his
 scholarship and a fondness for rhythmic prose, heavily loaded
  with Sanskrit compounds. Evidently he wished to excel Ghinnaya
 Suri in that style of writing.'
     Guruzada Sri Ramamurti (1851—1900); He wrote prose
 works almost in Ghinnaya Suri’s style: Chitraratmdcarmt the
 story of Kalapumodayam, the biography of Appaya Dikshita and
^^^mmarasu Charitra. But his Keai Jemtar^lu affords good readihg
     ^t contains interesting details of the poets lives. But they are
PARAVA8TU GHINNAYA SURI                                           115

 not quite reliable, for the author mixes up fact and fiction. They
 have been, nevertheless, very popular and widely read in the
 Telugu country.
^ Mantripragada Surya Prakasa kavi (1808—73): He composed
 Sita Rama Charitra in prabandha style and Krishnarjuna Charitra as a
 dvyarthi kavyay narrating two stbries Parijatapaharanam and Subhadra-
 parinayam with the same set of verses. Sri Vikrama Deo, Maharaja
 of Jeypore (1869—1952), a great scholar of Oria, Telugu and
 Sanskrit, and a poet in all the three languages, was so enamoured
 of this dvyarthi kavya that he wrote# and published a commentary
 on it. This Maharaja was a liberal patron of letters but too
 conservative to welcome the modem Telugu movement.
    Matsa Venkata kavi (1856—1903) a Telugu poet of old Ganjam
 District wrote Suddha-Andhra-Niwachana Pfiroshthya KusorLava Charitra
 (pure Telugu, all verse, without labial sounds) as a poem. It
 relates to the story of Kusa and Lava from Uttara Ramayana, It
 was composed in a very artificial style and there are in it, as a
 matter of necessity archaic and obsolescent words which cannot
 be readily understood by the ordinary reader.
    There were in those days pugnacious scholars and poets who,
 whenever an opportunity came, were ready to indulge in literary
 contests to outwit their rivals. Allamaraju Subrahmanyam
 (1831—1892) was a poet under the patronage of Rao Gangadhara
 Ramarao of Pithapuram and composed many kauyas. He dedicated
 his Bkadra Parinayam to his patron. Madabhushi Venkatacharya
 (1835—1895) of Nuzvid in Krishna District was an unrivalled
 satavadhani (one that could compose 100 verses at one stretch,
 according to the theme and metre required by the audience) and
 composed several poems like Bharatabhyudayam (based on the
 story of Sakuntala and Dushyanta). These two poets once
 entertained their respective patrons, the Maharaja of Pithapuram
 and the Rajah of Nuzvid, when the Maharaja and Rajah were
 together at Pithapuram. There was an interesting literary combat
 between the poets. Both could exhibit extemporaneous composi¬
 tion of verses on the spot. The former of these two poets proved
 superior iiT poetic art and the latter in his extraordinary memory
 and ability to repeat a new verse on hearing it only once.
    Avadkanams — Ashtavadhanam and Satavadhanam — became a
 notable feature of this period; it is probably a special feature of
 die Teli^ poets. By Ashtaottdhanam is meant diA perfermance
116                               HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE.

of eight feats of intellectual importance during the same period
   time. Eight scholars sit round him, each with an item assigned
to him to engage the performer; one would ask the Ashtavadham
to compose a verse with a particular theme in a particular metre; •
another would request him to compose a verse avoiding the letters
of the alphabet which he (the projposer) bans; another engages
the performer in desultory conversation; another eng2^;es him
in a game of chess; another strikes a bell now and then, and the
performer should tell the total number of strokes at the end;
another shows him a slip on which a single syllabic letter of a verse
or sentence is written along with its serial number. These'slips
are shown now and then in an irregular order during the perfor¬
mance, and the performer has to give out at the end the complete
vewe or sentence in its regular order. By Satavadhanam is meant,
composition of one hundred verses at a stretch in a conventional
order. One hundred persons sit in the hall, each with a suggestion
regarding the theme, and the metre. The performer has to
dictate the first lines of the hundred verses, one after another, to
each of the hundred persons assonbled. Then, the second lines
are dictated by the performer, recollecing without any help from
the audience, the first line he had dictated. This is a tedious
♦aA for both the performer and the audience, and to reduce the
tediousness a cemvention has developed by which the audience
may be satisfied with thirty or forty verses and the performer may
dictate the first two lines on one day and the remaining two lines
the next day. The performer has to depend entirely on his
memory, and is not expected to get any help in recollecting the
        or metre or the lines which he had previously dictated.
He should not note anything on paper.
                  Venkatacharya nsendoned above was probably
the first known Aoadhm of fome in the Telugu country. His
 performance at Pithapuram was a source of inspiration to die
DevuJapalh brothers—Subbaraya Sastri (1853—1909) and Knshaa
Sastri (1856^1912); the younger was aho known as 'Hiaaiiiayya
 Sastxi (TammayYa means yofunger btother) and he was. ifee fodier
 of Krishna Sastri, one of the most famous poets of           prmH
  generation. The brothers were eminent Telugu poets.
    When once in November 1879, Venkatacharya peffossotd a
 Sdtitvad^nam in the presence o£ Gangadhara Raiqaa Had, die ’
 Rajah of Pithapuram, the Rs^ was immensely pleased aiid;
 iPARAVASltr QHINNAyA SURI                                     117

enquired casually if, in his Zemindari, there was any poet who
could perform such a satavadhamm. One of the courtiers said
that the Devulapalli brothers were capable of doing it. They
were then at a village a few miles away from Pithapuram. The
Raja sent for them and requested the elder brother to perform it.
Neither of the two brothers had ever practised it previously and
yet Subbaraya Sastri readily consented to do it. The performance
was arranged the next day and it proved a marvellous success.
On another occasion, Kuchimanchi Venkata Kavi, the court-
poet of Pithapuram, casually reid h verse from Rasika Jema
Manobkiramam, composed by his great grandfather, Timma Kavi

       * Nadama pokkili? jambu nadama maichaya, kokanadama
    padam? a padama jada? nadumu myatpadama'^ nugam gudha
    padanui? chehkm !

It means:

       ‘ Is my beloved’s navel a pond ? her colour, gold ? her
    foot, a red lotus? her plait long to reach her heels? her
    waist, the skyey line? and the downy streak on her belly,
    a reptile? ’

and with an air of vanity he said, * Is any poet now capable of
composing such a charming verse ? * Subbaraya Sastri immediately
composed the following verse:

      ^ Rasama tanmuchi? jita sarasama vadanamhul Vanadheara
    samahita sarasamanama kachamu ? Sarasama nada ? nuduaul
    amrUa ftisama? cheltkin! It means:

       Is the lustre of my beloved’s body mercurial? Docs her
    face excel the lotus? her hair on a par with the essential
    feature of a gathering cloud? Is her gait the gait of dbe
    swan?« Is her speech the essence of neCtar? *

  Subt^uaya Sastri composed several poems in Telugu of which
hit Malundra Vijaimi in prabandha style is the best. His Sanskrit
pom, kasu Vamsa Midktaaali (an account of the Ram fomily to
which the PHhapuram Rj^as bdonged) was translated into Telugu
 118                                  HISTORY OF TELUOU LITORATURB


   verse by “Tammayya Sastri, bis younger brotiher. The latter
   composed also a poem known as Tatiraja                Vhich indicates
   the victory of Vaishnavism. The brothers represent the past
   generation of prabandha poets.
      The members of the Allamarazu family were eminent jxiets
   and noted for avadhanams. Allamarazu Rangasayi (1860—1936)
   could perform satavadhanam and ashtavadhamm until he was
   seventy years old. He was also the author of a Telugu version
   of the Sanskrit Champu Ramayamm^ Champu Bharatam and his verses
   have an easy flow and are mClodious.
      A sensation was created in the country during 1890—1920 by
   a rapid succession of three different sets of twin poets viz., Tirupati
   Venkatesvarulu (Divakarla Tirupati Sastri and Ghellapilla Venkata
   Sastri), Kopparapu Sodamlu (brothers) and Venkata Rama*
   krishna Kavulu (Olcti Venkatarama Sastri and Vedula
   Ramakrishna Sastri) who carried on their avadhanams in a spirit
   of vivacious emulations and, more frequently, of vindictive vitupera¬
   tion. There was a triangular literary fight among them, and
   they indulged in darting against one another extempore verses
   and even long poems which were caustic and sometimes to good
   taste. The activities of Venkata Ramakrishna Kavulu had only
  a limited sphere. Kopparapu Sodamlu excelled in rapidity of
  composition and it is said that it was impossible for any scribe to
  take down the verses that came out of their lips. But the composi¬
   tion was sometimes faulty in grammar and metre, nor was there
   commendable poetic merit in the verses, except in a few occasional
   flashes. It may be said that the twin-poets Tirupati Venkates-
  warulu commanded the greatest respect in the country.
      Of the first set of twin-poets, Divakarla Tirupati Sastri (1874—
   1919) excelled in scholarship while Ghellapilla Venkata Sastii
  excelled in the charm and rapidity of his composition. With
  the premature death of Tirupati Kavi in 1919, Venkata Sastri
  felt utterly forlorn, for he had lost a dearly loved friend and
  comrade. And yet he carried on his literary work with vigour
  and won immense fame. He was appointed as the grst Telugu
  poet-laureate when poet-laureateships for the four South Indian
  languages and Sanskrit were instituted by the Government of
  Madras in 1949. Many of the poets of the present generatioii
  are proud of styling themselves as disdplqi {sisJ^as)^ of Tirupati
^ Venkata Kavulu viz., Awari Subrahmanya Sastri, Veturi Prabha*
PARAVASTU caONNAYA SOW                                        M9

kara Sastri, Veluri Sivarama Sastri, Pingali Lakshxnikantam,
and Katuri Venkateswara Rao. Visvanatha Satyanarayana was
Venkata Sastri’s student in the class-room only, but has been
considerably enthused by him. There have been many Ekda^a
disciples also.
   Tirupati Venkatesvara Kavulu were prolific writers. They
composed poems—original as well as translations—^and a number
of Telugu dramas. Their collected works were, some years ago,
published in several volumes. Their five dramas relating to the
Pandavas of the Mahabharata st»ry»have been very popular.
They have been frequently staged all over the Telugu coimtry,
and the verses contained in them as well as in their Sraoananandam,
a poem of erotic sentiment, have been so popular on account of
their charm and melody that they are on the lips of many cultured
Tclugus; and even the unlettered cart-drivers recite them with
great delight. Dembhagavatam and Buddha Charitra among their
major poems have been recognised as the best of their poetical
works. There is good poetic merit in their other writings also
such as PanigrUiitay Lakshanaparinayamj Guntum simay and Nanaraja
Semdarsanam; their Mrichekakatika and Balarameyana, though,
translations from Sanskrit, read like original productions.
   At a time when Telugu poetry had lost its prestige—^whatever
be its cause—^Tirupati Venkata Kavulu succeeded in regaining it..
Their popularity is largely due to the harmonious blend of the
finest old and the new poetry. As one of their disciples, Pingali
Lakshmikantam said on one occasion, Tirupati Venkatesvarulu
sang their bharata vakyam (valedictory) to the old poetry and their
warm welcome (nandi) to modern poetry. Rules of old grammar
and outmoded conventions never impeded the majestic current
of their poetical stream. They were convinced of the soundness
of the modem Telugu movement for they had already realised
the eflfeteness of old grammars and the vigour of the new
expressions.
   Venkata Sastri wrote his later prose compositions like Kasiyatra
in the spe^en dialect of the cultured Telugus.
   Venkata Ramakrishna Kavulu, the second set of twin^^poets >
also deserve mention here. Oleti Venkatarama Sastri (1^3—
 1939) and his cousin, Vedula Ramakrishna Sastri (1889—1918)
were appointed as the court-poets of his estate by the present
Maharaja oi Pithapuram. The younger of these two, Rama-

    krishna Sastri was a prodigy; he translated Marakasura Vij(^
    Vjfqyogam in his 11th year; composed Damaj^anti Kdlyanam in * pure *
    Telugu verse in his 14th year, and later on his Kukam Mndanam
   in Prakrit and Kama Vijaya Vycyogam in Sanskrit. When he died
    at the early age of 29, Venkatarama Sastri bemoaned his loss,
   and in his lamentations, addressed Sarasvati, the Goddess of
   learning, and said: *our Ramakrishna was born in our family
   as Thy incamadon. If he were alive I would not have approached
   thee for help in my literary pursuits
      Gharla Narayana Sastr,' (J881—1932) was a great scholar
   and well-versed in Telugu language and grammar. He wrote
   in easy Telugu verse Marayaniya Andhra Vyakararum based on old
   grammars and provided for forms of later development.
      Kalluri Ven^tarama Sastri (1857—1928) wrote a valuable
   commentary on Chinnaya Suri’s Balavyakaranam known as Guptartha
   Prakasika. His translation of Kalidasa’s Meghaduta is regarded
   as one of the best translations of the poem.
      Vedam Venkataraya Sastri (1853—1929) was a great scholar
   of Sanskrit and though not an authority in Sanskrit vyakararuif
   or tarka or vedanta sastras, he was a profound scholar of Sanskrit
   literature.
      While he was Sanskrit pandit in the Madras Christian College,
  all his students (including myself) admired his teaching as very
  interesting and illuminating.
      His scholarship of Telugu language and literature was also of
  a high order, though he blundered at several places in his writings.
  He edited Srinatha’s Sringara Naishadhamt ELrishnadevaraya’s
  Amuktamalayada and Chemakuri Venkata kavi’s Vijayavilasam as
  well as Sarangadhara Charitra, with exhaustive commentaries which
  «diibit his vast knowledge and critical acumen. He was the
  author of many books of which some were original and others
  were translations from Sanskrit. Among his original works the
  dramas are important, viz., Usha based on the Puranic story and
  Bobbin Natakamy based on the historic battle fought at Bobbili
  in 1757. Through the machinations of Vijayaramaraja df
^ Vizianagaram the French leader, Bussy attacked Bobbili and
  killed the valiant chief Ranga Rao. Mallama Devi, Rani of
  Bobbili and the other ladies of Ranga Rao’s household^ like RadRut
  heioines, killed themselves to avoid dishonour* It was a great

  tragedy. The drama is Prataparudriyem which will be noticed
  in detail under the heading of dramas.
     Vaddadi Subbarayudu (1854—1939) was one of the gems
  which Rajahmundry produced along with Viresalingam Pantulu
  and Ghilakamarti Lakshminarasimham. He was a typical pandit
  and scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu. He translated Kalidasa*s
  Meghaduta, Abhijnana Sakuntalam and Vikram§fvasiyam\ the drama
 of Ventsamharam by Narayana Bhatta, Prabodha Chandtrodayam of
 Krishna Misra, and Bhaminivilasam of Jagannatha Panditaraya
 and other classics from Sanskrit. Of*them his Venisamharam is
 considered to be the best and is still enacted.
    Of his original Telugu compositions, Bhakta Chintamaniy a satakay
 is one of the most popular satakas and the verses of this sataka are
 sdll recited all over the Telugu country. His elegies relating to
 the death of his wife and the early demise of his son are full of
 pathos. He wrote, for the edification of the young several books,
 of which Sri Suktivasuprakastka was very popular for some years.
    Dasu Sriramulu (1846—1908) was a prodigy of learning. His
 memory was extraordinary; he could, like Madabhushi Venkata-
 charyulu repeat any new verse on hearing it once. In his 12th
 year he composed Somalingesvara Saiakem and in his 11th year,
 Satrajttamlasam as a yakshagana. He was a versatile genius well-
 versed in several subjects—Tarkay Dharmay Jyotiskay S(mgita and
 Abhinaya sastras. He was a scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu and
a good poet in Telugu. He translated into Telugu several Sanskrit
dramas viz., Ratna&ali of Harsha Dcva, Uttara Ramacharitra and
 Malatimadhavam of Bhavabhuti, and Abhijnana SakmUdam of
Kalidasa.
    His translation of Dembhagavatam (in 1908) towards the close
of his life is considered to be of the type of an epic poem among
Telugu classics. In the introduction to this book, Chellapilia
Venkata Sastri wrote; “ Among our contemporary poets, he is the
only one who has preserved the cultural traditions of our poets
    Under the caption of Telugunadu (region) he composed a poem
depicting t]|e several dialects of the Bnahman communities and
presented the typical didect of the pure Vaidik family. Hie
following lines may be quoted to illustrate that dialect:

122                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

    As he was interested in music and dance, he composed many
padams and javalis (songs full of erotic sentithent) which the
 dancing-girls of Eluru learnt from him and sang with abhinayam
 at public parties and in the temples.
   Tumu Ramadasa kavi (1856—1904) was a kapu of the peasant
family, in Warrangal, a disciple of Vaishnava Acharya from whom
he learnt Sanskrit and Telugu and practised the art of composing
Telugu verse. He composed in songs the story of Rukminikalyanam
and Gopika Vilasam and Mitravindodvaham in prabandha style and
 the dramas of Kalidasa*. ^Vhat is more interesting and more
important is his Lexicon known as Andhra Pada-nidkanamu^ which
he compiled during the last eight years of his life. It was no
 doubt based on Sahda Ratnakaram of Bahujanapalli Sitarama-
charyulu but he added the current words of Telengana relating
to tools, implements, village industries etc., as well as the local
idiomatic expressions.
   Kasibhatta Brahmayya Sastri (18G3—1940): He was a great
pandit well versed in Sanskrit and T elugu and an adept in writing
critical literary essays in Telugu. He was opposed to Viresa-
lingam Pantulu in all respects—in religious thought, social reform
and literature. He was always on the alert to expose the loopholes
in Viresalingam’s writings and social reform activities.
   His Bhaskarodantam is a treatise on the rival claims of Hulakki
Bhasakarudu and Mantri Bhaskarudu to the authorship of the
Telugu metrical Ramayana. It was published in 1898.
Brahmayya Sastri was of the opinion that the real author was
Hulakki Bhaskara and not the other; and this is the view of almost
all the scholars of this age.
   His Vivekachandrika Vimarsanam (also known as Rajasekkara
Charitra Vimarsanam) was a critique of Viresalingam’s novel, Raja^
sekhara Charitra^ also known as Vivekachandrika. It was published
in 1896 with the object of exposing the source of the novel. He
wanted to show that it was entirely based on Goldsmith’s Vicar
of Wakefield but clothed in Telugu robes, and that the author
concealed the fact in order to produce the impressiop that it was
an original novel. But the ciriticism savours of vituperadon.
Though it was based on Vicar of Wakefield, the novel was au
adaptation teeming with descriptions of Telugu life. Robert
Hutchinson translated this novel under the .^tlc * Fortune’s wheel *. “•
It was published at London in 1887 with a prdace by GmisesA*

   Macdonald. It belies the aggressive statements of Brahmayya
   Sastri.
      Vavilikolanu Subba Rao (1863—1936) was popularly known
   as Andhra Valmiki on account of his literal translation into Telugu
   of Valmiki Ramayanam. Though it was a literal translation, verse
   by verse, it runs smooth and the style is dignified. It contains
   some errors of grammar (judged according to his own standards)
   and misuse of expiessions, but it was on the whole in keeping with
   the classical traditions. There are vivid traces of the influence
   which Potana’s Bhagavatam cxercisecP oit him. He was proud of
   saying that he held Potana as his ideal in composition and in the
  matter of Bhakti. He condemned Appakavi who had refused to
  recognise Potana as an authority.
      His earlier poem Kumarahhyudayam was composed as a prahandha
  of the old type. He wrote a drama Subhadra Vijayam dealing with
  the marriage of Subhadra and Arjuna. After retirement from
  the Presidency College, Madras, where he had been a Telugu
  Pandit, he wrote the Kathanidht^ a series of stories for children,
  to instil devotion to God and to ancient Hindu ideals. He led
  a pious, devotional life and organised at many places Sn Rama
  bhakta mandali.
     Janamanchi Seshadri Sarma (1882—1953) was a Telugu poet
  worthy of being reckoned along with the poets of the early periods
  of Telugu literature. He was a good Sanskrit and Telugu scholar,
  and a prolific writer with twenty-five lengthy poems to his credit.
  He translated many Sanskrit Puranas of which the Brahmanda
  Purana was his mater-piece. His Sangraha Ramayanam was composed
  for the young and it was popular especially in the Rayalaseema
  districts. His Hndayanandam is a poem with an original theme
  affording, as the name indicates, happiness and delight to the
  heart. His* was a pure heart and when he was attacked by rival
  scholars, he used to smile and seemed to indicate * Well, let us
  agree to disagree ’. When once he was forced by his friends to
  speak at a public meeting in reply to a rival pandit’s adverse and
  aggressive ijpmarks against him and his poetry, he yielded but
  delivered a laconic speech and said: ‘ My surname is jana-mancki
  which means *good to all people’; why should I defile it by
  unpleasant rejoinders or repartees?’ The Andhra University
  recognised his poetical talents and conferred on him die significant
* title of KaUprapuma. The Rayalaseema districts and particularly
 124                                HISTORY OF TELUOU UTERATURB

  Guddapah, are very proud of him. He speiy: almost all his
  life there, and brought credit to himself and to the locality where
  he lived.
     I shall mention some pandits and scholars who also wrote some
  books that can find a place in Telugu literature, but their greatness
 was in the field of scholarship and training the prospective poets.
  Sataghantam Venkataranga Sastri, Dandigimta Suryanarayana
  Sastri, Chadalvada Sundara Rama Sastri, Nori GuruUnga Sastri*
 Tanjanagaram Tevapperumallayya (also known as Devaraja
  Sudhimani), Akondi Vyasaifturti, Vavilala Vasudeva Sastri, Padi
 Venkataswami, Panappakam Anantacharyulu, and his son,
  Srinivasachari, O, Y. Dorasamayya. For want of space, I shall
 give only a few details regarding the more important of them.
     Nori Gurulinga Sastri (1858—1912): He wrote in Telugu prose
 the story of the Mahabharatam. Nori Narasimha Sastri, a leading
 modern poet, is his elder brother’s son.
     Tanjanagaram Tevapperumallaya wrote in dignified Telugu
 prose the Ramayana, the Bhagavata and a considerable part of the
 Mahahkarata. He made a good linguistic study of Nannichoda’s
 Kumarasambh(wam comparing the language of this poem with the
 language used by Nannayya. He wrote scholarly introductions
 to several classics which he edited.
     Akondi Vyasamurti (1860—1916) wrote several books including
 translations of Sanskrit works, of which his translation of Anargka
 Raghava Naiakam by Murari (published in 1910) and his translation
of Prabodha Chandrodaya Matakam by Krishna Misra (published
 1910) may be regarded as the best. His translation of Ritu
Samharam was in ‘ pure ’ Telugu, rather a difficult task. His
language was chaste but his style was tough.
     Vavilala Vasudeva Sastri (1851—1897) was one among the
earliest graduates of the Madras University from the class of
orthodox pandits and scholars. His maternal grandfather was
Vathyam Advaita Brahma Sastri who had the honour of being
a tutor to G. P. Brown.
    Vasudeva Sastri served as an Assistant Lecturer ip English in
the Government Arts College, Rajahmundry. He was the first
to translate an English drama into Telugu. His translation of
Julius Caesar was published in 1876. He did it in Telugu verse.
In the introduction m his translation^ he sgys: * I bdUeve fhb it
the first attempt at translating an Engluh drama into corresponding *'

 Tdugu metre .. The metre that is adc^ted is Ma giti in which
 each line is independent tod consists of five ganas .. it corresponds
 to the English Iambus where each line is composed of five feet-*)
 The following lines are quoted to illustrate the style and metre
 he adopted: (from Antony’s speech-)

          “ Friends! Romans! and Countrymen!
          .... “ Saddhituluj Rmanuluy svadesasthularal
          Chevulu teravandi vinaga na cheppudani

          gam vanini nutiyimpa ganu gadu
          Brutasudu chalaga parvm gala vade
          migdina yandarum pamm gala van ”

   Vasudeva Sastri was also the first writer of an original drama
 in Telugu, known as Nandaka Rajyamu and it was published in
 1880.
   Probably Viresalingam lost sight of these dramas when he
 wrote in his auto-biography in 1919 that he was the first to write
  a drama in Telugu.
     Vasudeva Sastri translated into Telugu Bhavabhuti’s Uttara
  Ramacharitra and composed a Telugu poem Matrusoarupa Smriti
  (an ?idaptation of Gowper’s poem on his mother’s picture).
  His Rukmini Smaranam is an elegy in memory of his wife.
     Panappakam Anantacharlu was an eminent lawyer of Madras
  and a leader of the Congress Movement. He presided over a
  session of the Indian National Congress at Nagpur (1891). Besides
  some prose works in Telugu, he wrote a masterly essay in English
  on the comparative merits of the Vasu Charitra and Mmu Charitra,
  His son Srinivasacfoarlu wrote some Telugu plays and edited a
  literary joOTnal Vaijayanti,
     Among the Rajakamdu (poets from the ranks of Zamindars
  and Rajas) the most important are:
     Sri Vikramadeva Varma (1869—1952), Maharaja of Jeypore,
  was an Oriya by birth, but a great scholar of Telugu language
  and literature as wril as his mothci>tonguc, Oriya. He had also
  e g!Ood knowledge of Sanskrit and was a poet in all the three
  languages. He wrote several dramas in Telugu of whidi Srwkma
,           ^atekmu is the best. He was the founder dT and patron
  of a theatre at Visakhapataam, known as Jaganmiira Nadtdta Sola,
126                               HISTORY OF TELUQU LITERATURE

before he became the Zamindar of Jeypore estate. Later on,
he utilised his resources for the promotion of ledhiing in Andhra-
desa. He was a patron of education, of poets and scholars. He
contributed to the Andhra University huge funds for the expansion
of the University buildings and made an annual endowment of
Rs. 1,00,000 for the further process of its work. He was the
recipient of several titles from the public organisations and from
the Andhra University, viz., Sahitya Samrai^ Kalaprapurna and
Doctor of Letters.
   He was pious, devotional *and simple in life. Pandit Penuma-
chcha Satyanarayana Raju, one of the brilliant poets of this
century, was appointed as an Honorary Durbar poet of the Jeypore
Samstkanam by Sri Vikramadeva Varma, in 1942. This poet
refers with justifiable pride to his good fortune, in entertaining
this Maharaja as a guest, in one of the verses of his Telugu Raju»
(an auto-biography in verse) which says—

         Jayapunsuni dana sadanamhunaku bilchi
         gauravinchina yadi kaviyitandu

   It means—^This is the first poet who invited the Lord of Jeypore
to his house and honoured him.
   So simple, so courteous, and so obliging was the Maharaja to
his friends and to poets and scholars—^particularly to those whom
he patronised.
   He had been brought up in the old traditions of classical Telugu
and could not, therefore, appreciate the soundness of the modern
Telugu movement. Though he could not agree with G. V.
Ramamurti, the sponsor of tlie movement, he was hi§ warm friend
throughout his life and always remembered with delight, the good
old days when both of them were playmates in their childhood.
   Raja Mantripragada Bhujanga Rao of Eluru in West Godavari
district (1876—-1941) was another scholar and poet among the
2^amindars of Andhra Pradrah. He was the author of several
books, of which those that relate to the Christian faith (though
he was only an admirer of Christianity and not a Christian) are
particularly well written. He wrote in collaboration with
P. Chenchayya in English, a short book * A history of Telugu
Literature’ which was published in the * Heritage            India*
series. He was also a patron of leaminj* and a good fiiend of.

  Nandiraju Chalapati Rao whom he helped in building up the
  Manjuvani Press and in conducting the monthly Telugu journal
  Gr^ialakskmi,
    The Jagirdars of Jataprol and Partiyala were also patrons of
  poets. Elakuchi Balasarasvati who lived during the 17th century
  dedicated his Subhashitatrisati ^three centuries of verses) to Sri
  Surabhi Mallabhupala of Jataprol, and his Chandrika Parinqyam
 to the Goddess of Learning Sarasvati at the instance of his
 patron Jupalli Venkatadri, the Jagirdar of Partiyala. Surabhi
 Madhavaraya, son of Mallabhupikla,, also composed Chandrika
 Farinayam in the same ornate, dignified and tough style in which
  Vasu Charitra was composed by Bhattumurti. As it could not be
 easily understood by ordinary Telugu scholars, the Jagirdar had
 a commentary prepared, and distributed the printed copies to all
 Telugu scholars and poets.
    Velugoti Gopala Krishna Yachendra, Maharaja of Venkatagiri,
 was a great scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu and a patron of scholars
 and poets. He was the author of several books on Visisktaduaita
 philosophy.
    The Rajas of Pithapuram were great patrons of learning, and
 the present Maharaja of Pithapuram was a patron of p>oets and
 scholars like the Devulapalli brothers and Venkata Ramakrishna
 Kavulu. He published some Sanskrit books of the type of Rasarnava
Sttdhakaram with the Telugu translation by Bidusu Venkata
 Ramanayya, (a huge book on stylistic ornaments in Kcayas and
 Dramaturgy) and a Sanskrit drama Kuodaycmali (or Ratnapanchdika)
with my Telugu translation. Both the original Sanskrit works
 had been composed by Sarvajna Singabhupala of the 15th century.
    The Mah'araja of Pithapuram was the founder, patron and life
member of the Andhra Sahitya Parishad at Kakinada, which has
published under his patronage four volumes of a huge lexicon
known as the Suryarayandhra Mghantuvu and the last three volumes
with the financial aid of the Government.
   He was a staunch opponent of the modem Telugu movement
but after closer acquaintance with me in 1942 he realised that the
movonent was based on sound principles. He then modified
his views, and accepted the dedication of Varudhini Pravarddyam
by his son, Sri Gangadhara Rama Rao, the Yuvaraja of Pitha¬
puram in 1948, though the prose passages were all in the spoken
language. (Details of this book are given under Dramas).
 128                               HISTORY OF TBLUOU LTTBRATURB

      The Rajas of Viziaiiagaram, particularly the famous Aoanda
   Gajapati Maharaja, were great patrons of learhing and sevei^
   scholars of Sanskrit and Telugu flourished at the court of Ananda
   Gajapati. Mudumba Narasiinhachari (1840—1927) was a great
   scholar and poet that was patronised by him. Guruzada Venkata
   iA^pa Rao dedicated the first edition of Kag^asvUum to this great
   Maharaja.
      Kochcberlakota Ramachandra Venkata Krishna Rao (187i<-*
   1919) Zamindar of Polavaram, widi residence at Kakinada m
  East Godavari district was.a patron of letters. Tirupati Venkatea-
  varulu enjoyed his patronage, and Tirupati Sastri was his court-
  poet. He edited, for several years, a Telugu mcmthly journal
  known as Sarasoaii which was mainly devoted to publishing in parts
  the unpuUished Telugu poems of the great poets of the past and
  the poems and literary articles of contemporary writers.
     The Zaxnindars of Vuyyur were also patrons of Telugu poets
  and Sanskrit scholars. The present Zamindar Meka Venkatadri
 Appa Rao has composed several works of which a drama relates
 the story of the Kakatiyas and their internal and external feuds.
 His outstanding production is the translation into Telugu verse
 and song, of the Sanskrit AshU^adi of Jaya Deva.
     With the abolition of the Zamindaris, one great source of
 patronage for scholars and pioets has vanished, but the Central
 and State Governments have to patronise scholarriup and fine
 arts through well established organisations.
     I shall now resume my account of poets who commenced their
 literary career during the last century and continued during the
 early years of die {xesent.
    CHilakaasartt Lakshnal Narasimham (1867—1946) whs a prolific
writer in Telugu and his wwks cover several branches of literature.
He received his early education under the tutorslnp of orthcctoK
pandits, on traditional hnesL Ptiranapanda Mallaya Sastri^ who
rendered into Telugu the Sanskrit work, Sukraniiimam^ waa
Ghilakamarti’s maternal unde and VavUala Vaaudeva Seatri
was his teacher. With a good start in life, he rose to emilience
as an audior and as a social reformer. I must also aaake a paaiiag
reference to his vuried acthrsdes—the starting of sehoohi, the
removal of untoudsabitfty and other soda! evUi, and ^ promoti^
of the cause of nattonaliaiL 1 shall mention detaib regatiding
PARAVA8TU CHINNAYA SURX                                          l2d

 the journals he started or edited under Journalism; his dramas
 under the heading of Dramas; his novels under Fiction.
   His dramas, novels, stories, essays and other writings are
 innumerable in spite of his physical disability. In the course of
his early literary career he became blind; he had, therefore, to
get books or papers read to him and to dictate his compositions
to the scribes. He had to depend on others for correct proof
reading, and the neat printing and get-up of his publications.
   He was a good conversationalist and could entertain his listeners^
young and old, with his charming stalks. He was a great orator
and could speak for hours without tiring cither himself or his
audience; his speeches were always teeming with wit and humour
and with interesting anecdotes and entertaining information.
It would have been a very rich contribution to Telugu literature
if his speeches had been recorded, reproduced and published just
as they were delivered; but there were no tape recording fodlities
in those days. They were always delivered in the racy, idiomatic
and elegant spoken dialect of the cultured classes. He was not
an advocate of the modem Telugu movement. But like Viresa-
lingam Pantulu he developed a sympathetic attitude towards the
movement during the last days of his life.
   His memory was marvellous. One striking instance is enough
to prove it. During the days of the partition of Bengal and the
 Vande Mataram movement which was widespread in the country.
Bipin Chandra Pal paid a visit tofRajahmimdry in 1907 and
delivered a speech in the Town Hall for more than an hour.
As it was delivered in English, many among the audience who
did not know English requested the organisers of the meeting
to arrange for a Telugu version of the same. Ghilakamarti was
chosen for this task, as indeed there was none equally competent.
He gave an admirable rendering of the speech; he did not leave
out even a single important point mentioned by Bipin Pal. And
then he woimd up with a thrilling, patriotic extempore verse
in Telugu, very apt for the occasion:

         BSiavta khandambu ckakkean padiyam
         ffinduvuiu tega AidaUti edekuchmAt
         TtlUwaram gadasari goUa vmt
         BiudiSutdtiinmH matutu bigiya katti.

   It means:

      The huod of Bharat is a fine milch cow
      The Hindus are the calves and while they are crying
      The clever cowherds at dawn (or known as whites)
      Are miUdng, tightening up the muzzles (of the calves)

   There is a pun on the expression Tellavartma which admits of
si^itting as teUavaru + ofot meaning * known as the Whites ’ that
is the * the British ’ who Rre«, white in colour. The whole word
 means * at dawn       For a good many years this verse was recited
everywhere in the Telugu country and even today it is remembered
and repeated.
   By hearing the voice, Chilakamarti could immediacy recognise
the person, provided that person had been at least once introduced
to him previously and spoken to him Ibr a while.
   His verses are generally sin^e in ex{Mressiefi and cfignified m
thought His {»ose is almmt like that of Viresafingaxn with this
difierence—wh^ Viresalingam’s was unifesm in style firom start
to finish, Ghilakamarti’s had a rise and fall to suit the natural
modulation of voice when read out. Humour is common, to bod^
but while in the case of Viiesafingam it was somewhat poignant,
with Chilakamarti it was all sportive. And this was entkehr
consbtent with their resjpective mental traits.
   His Rajasthana Kaihaaati^ a trandation of die Annals of Ragasdtaa
by Todd is one of the best prose writings in Telugu literature.
   Sonthl Bhadradri Rama Sastri (1356—1915) was a great Sanskrit
pandit and a Telugu scholar and poet. Of his works KdanM
Pannoj^ and Chira Sima are the best. They contain a large
proportion of pure Telugu expressions. He also wrote a Triugo
commentary on AhobalapandUifmt a Telugu gnaamar in Saiisfcrit
based on Andhra Sahda Chintamaiu^
   Taduri lakshminarasiaaha Kavi (185&-~i936) was a goed
Sandcrit and Telugu scholar and a poet of merit.. Many ef hii
works were composed after 1912. He translated into Tdiigtl
verse Chandralokam, a Sanskrit work on figures of                       "
relating to poetics, the Bhagfoatf^ta and the first part ef Katidaift*i

   Gnatha Chintmam^ published at Nellore* Though his ataia
   dtgect was to public, part by pMrt, unpublished Telugu books
       the previoos generations, he devoted space to the literary
   articles of contemporary scholars, many of which are interesdiig
   and worth preserving. His editorials and reviews of books, and
   his biography of Mandapaka Farvatisvara Sastri are very valuable.
      Kuchi Narasimham (1866—1940): He wrote several poems
   of which Gaurmga Chantra and Ramaknshna Paramahamsa Ckaritra
   are in simple language and good style. They are popular and
   widely read in the country. He^wa^ one of the compi^ of
   Swyar(^andhra Mghantuvu. He was a staunch advocate of classical
   Tehigu.
      Channapragada Bhanumurti was a scholar in Tdugu»
   Sanskrit and English with a highly cultivated taste. He
   wrote beautiful verse. His Bkarata Dhama Darsmam (a vision
   of India’s Dhanna, 1910) inspired the younger generation of
   Tdugu writers. He rendered King Lear into Telugu.
     Tripurana Venkata Surya Frasada Rao (1889—1945): Thoitgh
  his literary career belongs to the 20th century, he is moitioned
  here because he was brought up under old traditions and his
  poetical works were mainly translations from Sanskrit workk
  He was wedded to the classical language. He translated Kwima
  Sambhaoam, Raghuvamsam, Kirata/jmtyam, Uttara Ranuuharitra and
  Sri Ramasvamedkam (a part of Padmapmanam). They are noted for
  felicity of expression and corrector of translation. His degy
 in memory of his father, who died while the author was a young
 boy, is fuU of pathos. His father, Tammaya Dora (1849—1900)
 composed Devi Bhagavatam (translation from Sanskrit). Of aU
 the works of Frasada Rao, his adaptation of Kalidasa’s Megjkei
 DtUa in geya (or maira) metre is the best. Frasada Rao possessed
 p musical voice and used to entertain his friends with his melodioos
 recitatioii of his geyas which were greatly appreciated by h>s
 listeners.
    I^angipudi Venkata Sarma was a genuine product of the age
  of Vureiallngain* He was a friend of the distressed men and
  woeacn; a^sodal leformer, at heart, in speech and actum. He

 literature that flooded the country in the later years. He
 championed the cause of the Harijans, several years before it WES'
 taken up by Mahatma Gandhi. His Mruddha Bharatam reads,
 almost like a paraphrase of Mahatma Gandhi’s articles in Harijan^
 years later. He was excommunicated by his kith and kin and
 suffered poverty, but continued his' work courageously. He used
 to say with admirable fortitude that ‘ man does not live by bread
 alone     He was very keen on the education of women and,
 admired the movement started by Viresalingam in this connection.
 His Nitikatha Manjan and eDAcrma bodhmt were meant to be read
 by women.
    He wrote several Satakas on patriotic themes, Gandhi satakam,
 Bharata matru satakam and Andhra matru satakam and a few dramas
 of which Markandeya is the best.
    Rayasam Venkata Sivudu (1870—1952) may be regarded as
 another product of the age. He used to say that he was much
indebted to Viresalingam Pantulu for inspiration in his literary
and soci?l activities. He continued Viresalingam’s werk in
promoting the cause of education for women by starting a monthly
journal, ^anana Patnka in 1895 and kept it up till 1907. His
articles published in the leading Telugu journals, including his
own were his main writings in Telugu prose. He employed a
simple language consistent with the traditional grammatic rules.
Towards the close of his life, he wrote a short auto-biography
referring to the significant events in his life.
   Adipudi Somanatha Rao (1867—1941) was another disciple of
Viresalingam in the fields of social reform and literature. He set
a personal example in the matter of widow re-marriage. He
acquired scholarship in Sanskrit Telugu and Hindi. He translated
into simple Telugu verse Bhagavatgitay Kalidasa’s RaghuvamsOy
Kumara Sambhava and Meghaduta, Sanskrit Balaramayanam and
Rabindranath’s Gitanjali. It is said that he first embraced
Brahmoism and later on became a convert to the Arya Samaj.
Some say that he was an Aryasamajist and never a member of
the Brahmo samaj, though he had all respect and regard for
Viresalingam. He rendered into Telugu, the history of !Dayanan4&
Swamy and other authoritative books relating to the Arya Sami^
from Hindi. He also learnt Tamil and translated into Telugu
verse Kamba Ramayanamy but this has not been published.
   He could sing well and entertain his audftnee vdth HartkaiHa
  PARAVASTU GHINNAYA SURI                                        133

   performances of his own composition. He was a very simple^
   pious and devoted soul.
      Kavuta Sri Rama Sastri (1875—1947) was almost of the type
  of Adipudi Somanatha Rao. He was an ardent social reformer
  and married a virgin widow But while Somanatha Rao kept
   himself aloof from politics, Kavuta developed the spirit of
  nationalism and took an active part in the Vandemataram movement.
   He also possessed a bold musical voice. He always commenced
   his public speeches with a patriotic verse or song. He learnt
  Bengali and translated into Telugu the works of Asvini Kumar
  Dutt. He started a Telugu monthly magazine Sarada in 1923
  at Masulipatam. Dui mg its all-too-brief existence Sarada rendered
  immense service to the cause of culture by publishing valuable
  articles on literature and the fine arts with excellent pictures in
  tricolour and halftone. He wrote some books in Telugu prose
  which aroused considerable interest. His sons Rama Mohan
  Sastri and Ananda Mohan Sastri became famous painters.
    Janamanchi Venkata Ramayya (1872—1933) was a good poet
  known for simplicity, lucidity, melody and chastity of expression.
  He translated many Sanskrit dramas of which his Malatimadhavam
 is the best. He wiotc several short poems of merit which appeared
 in the Telugu journals of the days. One poem based on a tragic
 incident of a beggar boy is very pathetic and appealing.
     Vatsavayi Venkata Niladri Razu (1881—1931) known as
 Kaviraju, translated many Sanskrit dramas and attempted to
 convey, through his free translations, the real significance of the
 original as explained in the commentaries.
    Umar Alisha (1885—1945) was a Muslim and a scholar of
 Telugu as well as Urdu. He was well acquainted with Sufism.
 He translated Omar Khayam into Telugu verse and it is one of the
 best Telugu versions of that poem. He wrote several dramas of
 which Kamaparvam is the best, in which there is a verse which
shows that he became a poet before he was twenty years of age,
    Sringarakavi Sarvarayadu (1865—1939): There is a story
that accounts for the surname, Sringarakam, One of the poet*i
ancestors wrote poetry which was full of the sentiment of love.
Sarvarayadu was a prolific writer. He mentioned, in a lengthy
verse of 21 lines, the nafiim of all the 91 works he had written.
They were of ordinary merit. Though there are in some poems
flashes of poetic merit, they are few and far between.
 134                                 HISTORY OF TBLUOU LITERATtJIlE

    Achanta Venkataraya Sankhyayana Sarma                            was
 a brilliant scholar of several languages—^Telugu, Sanskrit, Prakrits
 and English. He was a good critic of art and had a fine literary
 taste. Unfortunately he developed a perfection complex on
 account of which he used to condemn his own compositions,
 though his friends appreciated them, and never published them
 unless he finally thought that they were worth publication. He
 was a good conversationalist and could entertain his listeners for
 hours without tiring himself or his listeners. His speech was
 teeming with humour which was apparently sportive but sometimes
 very poignant when the implication was clearly understood. His
 short poems like Chandamama, meaning moon, published in 1903
 in the Telugu monthly Sarasvati, were among the earliest short
 poems in Telugu literature. He started a monthly Telugu journal,
 known as Kalpalata in about 1903, which he carried on for several
 years. It was then very popular, because it contained many
 useful and interesting articles on various subjects relating to ancient
 and modem culture. What attracted the readers most was the
 Qpiz section of the journal. He was publishing in his journal
 part by part, questions of literary interest and value. He offered
 prizes in cash to the best three sets of answers. Among the
 recipients of the prizes were scholars and poets who later on made
 a mark as prominent men of letters such as Nadakuduti Virariyu,
'Balantrapu Venkata Rao and Oleti Parvatisam of Kakinada.
 The Qpiz published by Sankhyayana Sarma encouraged the
 young scholars—and even the elders of the day—^to study Teli^
 literature and delve deep into it for answering the questions, which
 revealed how extensive and varied was the knowledge which
 Sankhyayana Sarma possessed. Of the few woiks which he
 published, the prose version of the story of Uitararamacmitra is die
 best; it is in good refined language; his Rakasya darpandnt which
 is also in good prose relates to the mysteries of plant life and sets
 a model for writing on scientific subjects in prose.
    Ghetti Lakshmi Narasimham (1882—1941) was a good schdiar
 of Telugu language and literature and a charming poet* He
 wrote a few short poems for children and poems like Pamm iyt, story
 of Rajasthan) in metre metre. His verses describing Ravi Vanpe'e
  pictures were published in the leading Ttiugu joumab like Bkartuti
  and they were read with great interest. 0£|us longer poems, the
       relating to Dmioreta (or Bhishma) is of tl^ claisfeat Matya type*
MRAVABTU OtGOaVAVA BUm                                           lIS

During the laBt days of his life he was attached to Sri Vikrama
Deo, Maharaja of Jeypore, and served as his private secretary.
In diat connection he composed Sri Rama Pattabkishefca
meant ibr reading and not acting, and dedicated it to the Maha¬
rajah on the eve of his PattabhUheka celebration. Further mentioa
of this poet will be made under the modem Tdugu movement
and dramas.
   Marepalli Ramachandra Sastri, popularly known as Kavi gaam
was a contemporary of Ghetti Lakshmi Narasimham and a pandit
in the London Mission High School at*Visakhapat3iam. He was,
no doubt, a good teacher but his fame was hu'gely due to his
literary work. He was for sometime connected with the dramatic
activities of Visakhapatnam and wrote several dramas for the
local dramatic associations. They were popular in those days.
There are several scholars and poets who are proud of saying
** We were the students of Kavt gam         He started a Lexicon to
which he gave the name of a Telugu Mudikadalt meaning “ the
ocean of Telugu words ”, but I do not know if it was completed*
His concordance of Nannaya’s words was completed and a press
copy of It was shown to me. It is expected to be published in a
shmrt time.
   I shall give an account of the literary work done by his disciples
in the next section.
   I have reserved to the last my account of iCokkonda Venkata*
ratnam Pantulu and shall present it here. His life and worh
illustrate the typical features of die age of Vires^ingam PantuJn
and deserve special treatment.
   Kokkonda Venkataratnam Pantulu (1842—1915) was a great
scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu, and a purist in all respects. He
was always using the riassical language, even in his ordinary
conversation, and in his talk with unlettered domestic servants
and common beggars. People felt amused and smiled at his
words. They made fun of his artificial language behind his bade
because even the staunchest advocate df classical Telugu raerved
it for Ictecary composition, either prose or poetry, and used only
the spoken dtaieet in conversation. Kokkonda was tibe only
exception.
   Ife was tbs antibot of several woi%8 and among his eaiiaer
fnfeduerionst six are worthy of notice: viz., Mtubmdrikat
           ^ Pflh^etfdiRlra (prose) pnbiished in    a paiem,
  136                               HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURS

   expressing joy at the assumption of the title of Empress of India
   by Queen Victoria, published in 1876; Bilwsvanyam, the story
   of the Saiva shrine of Bilvatanya (at Tiruvalam, Gudiyattam
  Taluk in North Arcot District) a Telugu poem in six limbos (or
  cantos) indirectly setting forth ^ modified form ofSamkhya
  philosophy of which the author was very fond, published in 1893;
  Kumara Nrisimham or Korkonda Mdhatmyam in verse based on the
  sacred legend of the hill of Korkonda published in 1903; Sankara
  Vijayadhvajam in prose, giving an account of the career of Sankara-
  charya, written under the*instructions of Paramahamsa Brahma-
  nanda Sarasvati, published in 1904; and Mangalagtri Mahatmyam,
  a poem in six cantos on the legends and cult of the sanctuary of
  Nrisimha at Mangalagiii in Guntur District, published in 1910.
     He was the author of two plays of Vy(^oga class among the
  Dasavidha rupakas mentioned in Sanskrit Dramaturgy, viz,,
 Dhananjaya Vijaya Vy ay ogam and Narakasura Vijaya Vyay ogam. The
 former deals with the victory of Arjuna and Ithe latter with the
 fall of Narakasura.
     His Andhra Prasanna Raghavam was a translation of the Sanskrit
 di^ma of that name. Vedam Venkataraya Sastri wrote a critical
 review of this translation which bulged into a huge size-—thrice
 as much as the translation. He pointed out several hundreds of
 errors in language and translation. In doing so Venkataraya
 Sastri exceeded the limits of decorum and justice. Later on
 G. V. Ramamurti demonstrated with the aid of authoritative
quotations how unjust and incorrect was Sastri’s criticism and
 he actually enumerated a hundred and one errors committed
 by Sastri when he misinterpreted the correct expressions of
 Kokkonda as mistakes in language*
    Just a word to account for the animosity displayed by Sastri
and also by Viresalingam Pantulu towards Kokkonda. Kokkonda,
as stated above, was a purist to the core. At a time when it was
considered very difficult and almost impossible to deliver Telugu
speeches in the classical language, Kokkonda delivered such
speeches, sometimes in rhythmic style also. The Brit^h Govern¬
ment conferred on him the tide of Mahamahopadkyayaf and this
provoked the jealousy of contemporary scholars and poets, parti¬
cularly those who thought that they possessed a higher degree of
scholarship in Sanskrit and Telugu. Mor^ver, by that time,
sqFeral coteries of pandits and poets were ibrmed to maintain the
 PARAVASTU OHINNAYA SI^U                                          137
  greatness of their respective mast<»^, viz., Viresalingam Pantulu,
  Xokkonda Venkataratnam and Vedam Venkataraya Sastri.
   There were also rival Tclugu joiirnals in which they could freely
  -attack one another. Viresalingam Pantulu had his Vivekavardhani
 and Kokkonda his Andhra Bhaska Saryivam; the Amudrita Grantha
 Chintamanit edited and published by Pundla Ramakrishnayya of
  Nfllcre, was always supporting and exalting Vedam Venkataraya
  Sastri, the editor’s personal friend. There was a triangular fight
  in the literary battlefield among these three mighty scholars of the
  age, and there were ramificationif among their admirers and
  followers. Some of their ai tides were no doubt interesting and
  edifying, but the rest weie annoying because they contained
 vituperative, caustic criticisms and unpleasant rejoinders and
 repartees. G. V. Ramamurti, being the sponsor of the modern
 Telugu movement, had no particular partiality for either Kokkonda
 or Venkataraya Sastri who were equally opposed to the movement
 but he attacked the latter for having unjustly criticised the former.
 In doing so, Ramamurti also indulged in vituperative criticism*
 particularly because Venkataraya Sastri had unjustly used
 indecorous language and also because he wanted to pay Sastri
 in his own coin.
     Panuganti Lakshmi Narasimha Rao (1865—1940) must be
 mentioned in this section, because he belonged to the age of
 Viresalingam. He felt that the social and literary creed of Viresa-
 lingam and his followers, produced a baneful effect on the young
 men of the age, by an indiscriminate and almost complete destruc¬
 tion of faith in the hoary traditions of the past. He admitted
that there had developed some evils in society requiring rectifica¬
tion, but he was of the opinion that they should be set right without
destroying the inviolable sanctity of Hinduism and the social
fabric based on it, or the good traditions connected with it. He
wanted to effect a counter-reform not through controversy or
speeches at public meetings, but through his writings. Wit and
humour are the prominent features of his literary productions—
whether tljpy were social dramas like Vrtddhavwaham or Kanthri
bharanam or essays, a voluminous collection of which was published
imder the caption of Sakshi (Witness). He too wanted to expose
the irrational belief in tradition that had been encouraged by
adfeeeking sections of society having power and influence. But
he did not accept ihe view that everything in the West was perfect
138                                HISTOIT   OF muou URUUkfm
and everything Indian rotten, and that, therefore we         fhoaid
adopt the manners and customs and social lifo of &e West. Hb
art lies in concealing the (foject he had at heart.   He would leave
it to his readers to think for themselves.     Almost every reader
thought he was bemg hit, but nqne could complain against the
author, for he would say in response to any such complaint, ** If
the cap fits you, wear it ”.
  When he made fun of the crude religious beliefs of die people,,
he might be mbtaken for an irreligious person; but when we read
his drama, Radhakrishna We Viave a revelation of his piety and
adoration of the Divine.
  He was quite in favour of adopting whatever was really good
and worth adopting in the Western culture.    His study of Addison's
Spectator enthused him to write his essays in S(dcsht; the very name
of iS^rb'ineaning witness is based on Spectator (cf Lat, Spectares
see, frequent of specere=look.    Skt. spas=to see.).
  He opposed the modern Telugu movement, but he was not a.
purist. He freely used later forms of expression in Telugu, though
they were not in accordance with the old rules of grammar.
  Details of his dramatic art are furnished under Dramas.

             The Modern Telugu Movement
                    (1909--1920)

I SHALL present here an account of the Modem Telugu movement,
its origin and development, becausif there is at present no one so
intimately associated with the movement from the beginning as
myself. 1 acted as a scribe and assistant to my father G, V. Rama>
murti, the sponsor of the movement and worked with him at home
and abroad. I was a graduate teacher in the same college at
Parlakimedi in which he was then serving as a Lecturer in History.
After he retired from service in the college, in 1911, he continued
to spread his message of modem Telugu and I succeeded him in
the collie and continued to be his assistant in all his literary
activities.
   It was in 1906 that J. A. Yates,—^Inspector of Schools for thn
three northern districts of the Madras Presidency, old Ganjam,
Vizag and Godavari with headquarters at Visakhapatnam—^wat
surprised to note during his study of Telugu that there was a wide
gulf between the lan^age used m books and the langui^e spoken
by the people though both passed for Telugu. P. T. Srinivasa
Iyengar, die then principal of the A. V. N. College at Visakha*
patnam, whom he approached first for an explanation could not
give a satisiketory answer, but advised him to consult G. V. Appa
Rao at Vizianagaram and G. V. Ramamurti at Paiiakimedi.
Appa Rao said that he had already noticed the difference that
there was a greater vigour in the living language than in the
language of the books with its archaic and obsolete and obsolescent
expressions, and that, therefore, he had written his play Kanyasutiiaat
in 1897 in the living diaiect. He further stated that the spoken
language nrould not be accepted for use in school-books or oomposi*
tion or translation bv the mthodox pandits or scholazi. Rama'*
niuiti endnn^ the observations made by Appa Rao and vimtsd
time te think over this question, because he said, he was neither
a scholar ci clsissfoal, Tdugu Iteature nor an author like Appa

 140                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

     Ramamurti was, however, a good student jpi comparative
  philology—both Aryan and Dravidian; studied Max Muller,
  Sayce and Caldwell and possessed a working knowledge of the
  Dravidian languages; was well versed in English grammar and
  made a study of the history of th^ English language. He had a
  good knowledge of Sanskiit; what was more surprising was his
  study of the Savara language (of the Primitive people of the
  Mundari or San tali group). With this equipment he commenced
  the study of the Telugu classics, and of the Telugu grammars
 based on them. He was'kndwn for his indomitable energy and
 devotion to study. I’hough he was not then widely known in the
 Telugu country, he had been cairying on a voluminous corres¬
 pondence with European scholais, being one of the few scholars
 among the Telugus to study Ethnology and Epigraphy. He had
 deciphered some inscriptions and published his articles in
 Epigraphia Indica (Vol. IV) in 1894. His article on the Savaras
 was a valuable contribution to Ethnographic studies, and it was
 quoted in Thurston’s Castes and Tribes under the caption of
 Savaras. His article on the antiquities of Mukhalingam is a
 great contribution to the history of the Ganga dynasty in Kalinga.
    By 1909 he equipped himself with the lequired knowledge of
 the Telugu language and the classics; and at the request of Yates
addressed a Conference of leachcrs and pandits (which had been
 an annual function from 1907) on the origin and growth of
languages, with special reference to Telugu. It was, no doubt,
interesting and informative but it was received by the audience
with a kind of fear and suspicion regarding the motives behind the
speech then delivered by Ramamurti.
    It coincided with a significant change in the scheme of education
-—both in high schools and colleges; the Matriculation examination
was replaced by the School Final (or Secondary School Leaving
Certificate) Examination in the school course, and the F. A. (First
Arts) Examination by the Intermediate Examination in the course
of University studies. There were thorough changes in the mattar
of subjects to be studied and in their relative importance. Verna¬
cular translation and composition were made compulsory for both
the examinations in response to a note in the Education R^ort
of1905. It was observed in the report that the Univenuty graduates
who acquired knowledge through the medium of English were
not competent to impart it to the masses through the medium (d'
 THB MODERN TBLUOU MOVEMENT                                      HI

   their own mother>tongue. The Educational authorities thought
   that, as a remedial measure, they should encourage publication
   of popular books on scientific and other subjects and that, as a
  preparation for that, students of High Schools and Colleges should
  be properly instructed in translation and composition.
     The sponsors of the Modern Telugu movement thought that the
  most suitable language for translation and composition was the
  living language and not the archaic language of the classics. In
   1910 Ramamurti addressed the Teachers Conference once again,
  and referred to the effeteness of the qjassical language and the
  vigour of the living language and cited the analogy of the English
  language and modern English composition. His speech was very
  instructive but also very provocative—particularly to the pandits.
     The arguments advanced by Ramamurti and his supporters
  did not carry conviction, nor weie the pandits and other scholars,
  brought up in old traditions and not well acquainted with the
  basic principles of languages, in a mood to be convinced. The
 sponsors of the movement referred mainly to the general principles
 of languages and quoted the authorities of foreign scholars. P. T.
 Srinivasa Iyengar’s pamphlet ‘ Language—life and death ’ served
 only to increase the indignation of the opponets. And what was
 most provoking was the announcement that a book known as
 ‘ Greek Myths        written in Telugu prose by Chetti Lakshmi
 Narasimham, was prescribed as a text book for the School Final
 Examination of 1911, to serve as a guidance for Telugu composi¬
 tion. The language used in the book was not really gramya (vulgar)
 and was only an apology for modern Telugu. The only innovation
 wras the use of the apostrophic mark to indicate the liasion (a type
 of vowel sandhi) t and very few popular expressions current all over
 the Telugu country W'ere used. It was not so much the text of the
book as the preface written by P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar that irritated
the opponents. He gave them to understand that modem Telugu
 was a living language and, inferentially, that classical language
was dead.
    The opponents were not sufficiently acquainted with Rama-
murti’s attainments. His early speeches of 1909—1910 did not
show that he had studied with care the Telugu grammars and the
Telugu classics. He referred only to the characteristic principles
relating to the growth cd languages—^particularly the principle
that language naturally changes from time to time, and change
 142                                lOSTOKir OF TEUJQU LmHIUTUIUB

 is the law of life. Appa Rao was known only as the author of
 Kanyasulkam in gramya and that dialect might          used iii fiucces
 as Viresalingam Pantulu had used it for his prahosmas. They,
 therefore, sarcastically remarked that the sponsors of the movement
 were an Englishman, a Tamilian, and two Telugus who could
 not write in chaste Telugu—cHushtachatushtaycmf “ the wicked
 four
    “ The Greek Myths ” appeared as offensive to the pandits, who
 considered it gramya^ as the slogan of Vandemataram was offensive
 to the British who considered it as “seditious ” during 1906—1912.
 The orthodox pandits thought that the traditions of the country
 were attacked one after another; their religion was already in
 danger, and now the purity of their language was in the same
 plight. They looked for a leader and found in Jayanti Ramayya
 Pantulu a champion who could defend the supremacy of the
 classical Telugu.
    A monster petition was submitted to the Government with
thousands of signatures protesting against that text-book and the
 recognition of gramya (the contemptuous name given by the
 opponents to modern Telugu) for Telugu composition in schools
and colleges. But the petition exhibited an ignorance of the
fundamental principles of languages. For example, it stated that
the classical language of the modern kavyas had been the same as
that of Nannaya without any change, and was bound by the rules
of the same grammar Andhra Sabda Chintamam, known also as
Pfanmayabhattiyam. It ignored the gradual changes in diction,
grammatical structure and syntax.
   The belief among the pandits was that Nannaya wrote his
Tehigu grammar first to serve as the lakshana ordained by him,
and next his Mahabharata as a lakshya, to illustrate the rules of his
grammar.
   The University of Madras appointed a Telugu Translatson and
Composition Committee to suggat the course to be adopted in
the light of this controversy. There were on the Committee :^ur
members to represent Classical Telugu, and four to leprosient
Modem Telugu, and Prof. M. Rangacharya of tfa» Pfesidency
College, Madras, was appointed Chairman* Widi the note
the Chairman, a resolution was passed in favour of modem T^ugn
that ^forms that wave used in books as weU m in spetKh ndgbl
he recognised as stanchmd feu' Intennediate^elagis dEuafesHion.**#
rsa iMDBSN TKtmv mavemn                                          14S
 The discounted dasskuts then prevailed upon the schdars of
 the Rayalasima. to request the University authoridcs to enlarge
 the Committee to include representatives oi their r^on so that
 they could indicate the forms in use among them. The Committee
 was then enlarged by the inclusion of four representatives of the
 Rayalasima. But instead of doing the work for which they were
 appointed) they joined hands with the classicists and gave a strange
 interpretation to “ as well as ” in the wordmg of the resolution.
 They asserted that the committee*s earlier resolution meant to
say that the forms to be accepted shpul^ be such as were found in
 books and at the same time were in use when spoken. It is vory
surprising that this wrong interpretation was not successfolly
challenged and thrown out. If that were the correct interpreta-
 tion, there could be no justification for the appointment of
representatives of the Rayalasima region, to offer advice about
 the forms of speech current m that area. Moreover their isiter-
pretation would exclude classical forms not now spoken, and
^>oken forms not found in the classics; the greatest common factor
of the two would be then reduced to a limited vocabulary. But
there was a majority in their favour and they could pass any
resolutioa. The modernists felt disgusted and left everything in
the hands of the classicists, who had thus an easy victory. As a
result of the final resolution of the Committee, the syndicate
pronounced its verdict in 1914:—“The University gf Madras is
at present unable to accept what is known as Modem Tehigu
    But Ramamurti did not lose heart. By that time he had,
sufficiently equipped himself to defeat the classicists in their own
Beld. He toured all over the country, visited all places of
impcH'tance, particularly the collies in Andhra, and managed
to have committees of scholars to examine the evidence he showed,
to establish the usage of the ever-developing new feurms of speech
in Tekgu Kalyas, He carried with him a cart-load of manuscripts
and books that contained the evidence. He proved how his
opponents themselves wittingly or unwitingly made use of the
modem forms, which they condemned, in their own writings axid
hew somefimies they bungled by using forms which were not in
accordance with either classical sanctity or with modem usage.
   By        he became a popular %ure in the country. He won
     •app<^t of moojjt stalwart scholars and pandits who had earlier
opposed hiza* Hia crowiuag victory was achieved when Viresai-

   lingam Pantulu was convinced of the soundness of his argument
   and proposed to write a grammar of modeiH Telugu with the
   help of Ramamurti’s notes. But on account of his unexpected
   death, he could not do so.
      In 1926 Ramamurti delivered a speech for four hours at an
   annual conference of the Sahitya Parishat of Kakinada which
   was then held at Tanuku. Stalwart pandits and scholars (including
   the two prospective poet-laureates) were present. There was
   pin-drop silence when he was speaking.
      He emphasised the following points. The modem Telugu
   movement is mainly intended for prose writing and the refined
  speech of the educated in society {Stshta jana vyavaharika bhashd}
  should be the ideal; this movement is neither an innovation nor
   a revolution; it is a revival of the tradition of writing prose that
  had existed in the age of C. P. Brown until it was checked by
  Ghinnaya Suri, and it was Chinnaya Suri that was responsible
  for enforcing the archaic language of poetry for prose as well, and
  for setting back the progress of prose which had been developing
  on healthy lines; so far as poetical composition was concerned, the
  tradition of using new forms that developed in the language should
  be continued, as the poets had been doing in the past; the later
 grammarians were periodically revising the rules in the light of
 such new forms, though their work was imperfect and dialectal
 variations had never been condemned by any grammarian in the
 past. The poets used them and the lexicons accepted them.
     Ramamurti died on the 20th January, 1940. Just a week
 before that, he delivered his last speech before a small gathering
 of friends at Madras in a feeble tone, expressing his satisfaction
 at the progress of the movement. He thanked the journalists for
 their support of modern Telugu and exhorted them to get it
recognised by the Universities and the Government. He was
glad to learn that hundreds of books had been written and published
in the modem Telugu which he advocated. His speech was-
reproduced by me and was published in Prajantiira on the day
he died.
    My readers may be glad to learn that, as a member of the
Academic Council and Chairman of the Board of Studies in
Telugu, I moved the University of Madras to reconsider the
verdict pronounced by the Syndicate in 1914 against accepting
the modem Telugu for University purposes, and 8ucce^ed»

during 1955—58, with the support of my colleagues in the Board) in
getting the approval of the University for the use of modem Tclugu
forms by the Pre-University candidates in their Telugu composi¬
tions. It is expected that the three Universities of Andhra Pradesh
will, in the near future, follow the example set by the Madras
University and that the Andhra Government will do the same.
Modern Telugu is steadily and silently gaining ground in the case
of school books also, but it is to be regulated, instead of being
allowed to drift.
   An important point to be noted iii this connection relates to the
study of the classics in Telugu. The modernists never discouraged
the study of the Telugu classics, but, on the contrary, encouraged
a critical study of the same. They referred to what was obtaining
in England, and said that Telugu students should study old
classics like Nannaya’s Mahabharatanij Naishadham of Srinatha and
 Vasu dharitra of Bhattumurti, just as students in England studied
Chaucer, Spencer, Shakespeare and Milton. But Telugu students
as well as Tclugu writers should be encouraged to write their
compositions in modern Tclugu, as Englishmen would do in
 modern English.
   The part played by Gurazada Venkata Appa Rao in the progress
of the modern Telugu movement will be referred to in the next
section, as he was a creative artist in modem literature, unlike
 Ramamurti who was only a student of language and an author of
 books, all relating to language. Even his essays, though composed
in a refined style in modern Telugu, related to language.
 PART TWO



MODERN PERIOD

 (From 190<f A.]li«}
                            CHAPTER X

         The Modern Period of Telugu Literature
                        (During 20th century)

 The Modern       Telugu movement and the new trends in Telugu
  Literature are erroneously regardej^ as identical, and the relation
  between the two is not properly understood by some persons.
  Modern Telugu movement is practically an endeavour to revive
  the status quo ante Ghinnaya Suri, and the new trends in Telugu
 literature are the results of the influence of Western culture and
  the study of English literature. Even without the Modem Telugu
  Movement there could have been a development of the new
  trends, but much progress might not have been achieved in that
 direction, for a large number of writers were likely to be scared
 away by the classical or Kavya dialect in which they were expected
  to write any book. There are ever so many people who have
 ideas, but they cannot write in that dialect.    It may, therefore,
 be claimed for the Modern Telugu Movement diat it gave freedom
 of expression to the young writers. It has helped the growth of
 Telugu literature in this century.
    While the Telugu scholars acquainted with English literature
 made experiments on fresh lines, either in classical or modem
 Telugu, scholars not acquainted with English followed the tradi¬
 tions of the past. They copied the models set by the previous
 poets for their poetic composition, and the model set by Chinnaya
 Suri for their prose composition, with the same old themes and
outmoded patterns.
    Viresalingam Pantulu may be regarded as the pioneer of the
new trends, though he did not altogether abandon the old models.
He wrote books which represented almost all the new trends vix,
novel, story, drama, farce, essay, short poem, literary criticism,
biography, auto-biography and history of Telugu poets. There
might be a writer here or a writer there who had written previously
either a novel or a drama, but there was none previous to him who
had covered the whole range of Telugu literature as Viresalingam
did*

   Before I commence to review these new trends, I should like to
enumerate the various literary associations or Academies that have
been organized in this country, and describe their activities al
briefly as possible. An account of some important independent
writers is also given. Their works*wiH be briefly referred to in
this section and their place in literature will be determined under
the new trends mentioned above. This repetition cannot be
avoided, because unless at least a short account of the prominent
men of letters is given, their individuality and importance and
their wide contribution to literature cannot be adequat^y
appreciated.
                          CHAPTER XI

                      Literary Institutions

    Tha Andhra Sahitya Partshad (1911)
 It was organised in 1911 by Jayanti Ramayya Pantulu under
 the main patronage of the Maharaja of Pithapuram with the real
 object of suppiessing the niodem Telugu movement, though it was
 not explicitly mentioned in the aims and objects of the Parishad.
 It had a good start and was widely welcomed by pandits and
 scholars who had been eagerly looking for a leader, an association,
 and a literary organ that could save the time honouied literary
traditions which, they feared, the Modem Telugu movement
would destroy. In course of time their fears were proved to be
unwarranted and in spite of the opposition of the Parishad, Telugu
literature has developed on modern lines and the spoken dialect
has been extensively used in books.
   Except in the matter of hostility to the Modern Telugu move¬
ment, the Parishad has rendered great service to Telugu literature
in several ways. It collected a good number of palm-leaf and
other manuscripts yet unpublished; it started a bi-monthly Journal
known as Andhra Sahitya Partshad Patrika and published many
articles on literary topics and the unpublished books in parts.
It built up a good library and secured a spacious office at Kakinada.
   The Maharaja of Pithapuram (1885—1964) the founder and
patron of the Parishad, was a savant well known for his munificence
and patronage of several educational institutions and of poets and
scholars. He undertook to finance the publication of a voluminous
Telugu Lexicon which was started in 1918. The first volume
was published in 1938, and by 1948 three more volumes were
published. The last three volumes were in varying stages of
progress in the Lexicon Office. The delay was so annoying that
the Mahar^a closed the office and removed the entiae record to
Madras. The printing of the last three volumes was entrusted
to me in 1952. When after some formes had been printed the
Maharaja was unable to finance the fiurther progress of the work,
I applied for financial aid to the Govemment«^ith the permission
of the Mahar^a and secured substantia] help with which the
                                 152

iU^h and sixth volumes could be published and a major part of
^e seventh and last volume could be printed by 1959.
   Jayanti Ramayya Pantulu (1860—1941) was a scholar of English,
Telugu and Sanskrit and epigraphist devoted to historical research.
 He was the leading opponent of the Modem Telugu Movement.
 He was the editor of the first volume of the Suryataya Andhra
 Nighaniuim and also the author of several books in Telugu, viz,.
 Uttara Rama Charitra^ Champu Ramayanam and Amarukam—transla¬
tions from Sanskrit and Muktisvara Satakam.
    Vijnana Chandrika Mandali was*formed at Madras in 1911.
 It marked the beginning of a new era of high-souled endeavour.
The central figure responsible for its origin and development was
 Komarrazu Lakshmana Rao. He was assisted by Dr. Achanta
Lakshmipati and Gadicherla Harisarvottama Rao. The Mandali
 was financially supported by the Raja of Munagala. Lakshmana
 Rao was familiar with the progress made by the Maharashtrians
in their literature. They had by that time published books on
several subjects relating to modem culture and an Encyclopaedia.
 Lakshmana Rao was, therefore, eager to have similar publications
in Telugu. He gathered promising young writers and encouraged
them to write books entiusied to them. A book on Health and
Ayurveda was written by Dr. Lakshmipati; a History of the Andhras
by Chilukuri Virabhadra Rao; The Biography of Abraham
Lincoln by Harisarvottama Rao; a book on Physics by Mantri-
pragada Sambasiva Rao; a book on Chemistry by Vemuri Visva-
 natha Sarma, a book on Political Economy by Cattamanchi
Ramalinga Reddi. Lakshmana Rao himself had earlier written
the Biography of Sivajt. All these books were published during
the second decade of the 20th century. The Mandali published
also two novels—Vimala Devi by Bhogaraju Narayana Murty and
Rayachwu Tuddham by Ketavarapu Venkata Sastri.
   Lakshmana Rao (1877—1927) was a scholar of English, Telugu
Marathi, Sanskrit and Hindi, and an ardent student of Indian
History. He started writing Telugu books on Indian History and
publishec^the first two parts relating to the Hindu and Mohem-*
xnadan periods, but could not complete the British period on
accodnt of his premature death. His essays {Vyasavali) syrc very
iUuminating. The Andhra Vijnana Sarvasvam which he planned
tvas the first of its kind in Telugu. He was interested iti.

 Epigraphy and made valuable contributions to the advancement
 of its study in the Telugu country.                  **
   A very important achievement of Lakshmana Rao rriates to
 the cultural progress made by the *relugus of Hyderabad. The
 most prominent cultural instituti<)n for Telugus in Hyderabad
 known as Sri Krishnadevaraya Andhra Bhasha Mlayam was founded
 on 1—9—1901 through the efforts of Lakshmana Rao who secured
 the co>operation of Ravichettu Ranga Rao and the Rajah of
 Munagala. From its early stages, Madapati Hanumanta Rao
rendered great service to the (>rogress of this Bhasha Mtlayam*
   After the death of Lakshmana Rao this Vijnana Chemdnka Monddi
 was revived at Vijayawada by Ayyadevara Kalesvara Rao. Some
books on history were published—America Samyukta Rashtramula,
Breach Svatantrya Vtjayamu, China Jatiyodyamamu by Kalesvara Rao^
the Travels of Fahien and the Bauddha Mahayugam by Vduri
Satyanarayana.
   Ghilukuri Virabhadra Rao (1872—1939) may be regarded aa
the first writer in Telugu of the history of the Andhras. He wa»
the author of Jima Kamata SmrajyamUf biographies of Ttmmarasu^
 Ttkkanoj Srinatha, Stvajt and Nayokuralu (the Hero of Falnati
Yuddham).
   Gadicberla Harisarvottama Rao (1883—1960) was, throughout
bis long literary and political career, frequently subject to several
vicissitudes of fortune. He was one of the earliest to take die
M.A., Degree in Telugu, of the Madras University (1906). Hit
first literary contribution was the “ A Neglected Emperor Poet ”
{VtsmrUa R^ja Kavi Knshnadevaraya). This had been the theme
of the thesis for his M.A., examination. Abraham Lincoln mentioned
above was his second bodk of importance. He planned to write
a series of books under the caption of the history of the world in
Telugu. But his attempt was abortive on account of his polideat
actmtes and imprisonment. For sometime he was editor of the
Telugu daily, the Andhra Patrika. During the last twenty years
of his life he rendered honorary service to the library movmetlt
and the headquarters of the Andhra Library Assoc^iation at
Patamata I^uika—near Vijayawada—is known as Safif(iifkimk
fihaoanam in his honour. He was one of the editors of            0m
volume of Telugu Eneyek^edia (published by the Tetogu munhtt
Shmiti, Madras) along with me and I^raiapaghi Rmiaxnnrti, AiM
 UTBRAsy iNBTrruYioMi                                             155
   also of the second volume along with Vasanta Kao Venkata Rao
  and Vemuri Visvanatha Sanna.
      Dr. Achanta Lakshmipati (1879-^1961), a distinguished writer,
  was connected with the Vijnana Chandnka Mandalt as an associate
  of Lakshmana Rao. He was an M.B. of the Madras University,
  but very early in his career as a medical practitioner, he developed
  faith in Ayurveda. Lakshmipati has since then rendered great
  service to the progress of Ayurveda in the country and published
  several books on the subject.
     Andhra Bhashahktvardhant Sanghanf was started in 1908 at
  Masulipatam. It published several books including a translation
  of Mill’s On Liberty by D. Ramamurti and the lives of Rammahan
  Roy and Vtvekananda Swarm; but it was short-lived.
     Andhra Prachartm Granthamala was started first at Tanuku in
  West Godavari District in 1910 under the editorship of Ayyagari
 Narayanamurti. Later on, Kowuri Ramachandra Reddi became
 the patron of this institution. When Venkata Parvatisvara
 Kavulu became the editois, it made considerable progress at
 Kakinada. By 1930 it had published 170 novels and short stories
 many of which were translations of or adaptations from books in
 Bengali.
     Venkata Parvatisvara Kavulu is the composite name of the
 twin authors viz., Balantrapu Venkata Rao (1880) and Oleti
 Parvatisam (1882-^1955). Venkata Rao’s poem Ekanta Seva
 published in 1922 was at once recognised as a devotional lyric of
high quality, Devulapalli Krishna Sastri an eminent poet of the
 present age, wrote a charming introduction in which he said:
    Ekanta Seva is to Telugu literature what Tagore’s Gitanjah is to
 the Bengali”. Brindavana-Kanya dedicated to the Yuvars^a of
 Pithapuram is the best of the poems of these twin authors. It
excels, in poetic merit, the love poems of the poets of Tanjore.
The fast joint work of these twin-poets is Ramayana in a new garb.
It was incomplete by the time, Parvatisam died, but Venkata Rao
has now completed it. They were the authors of several novek,
referred to^bove, and ^o of other works which will be mentioned
in subsequent sections.
    Hdmiiku& Orantkamala at Chitrada, near Pithapuram in Eait
Qedavarl District was founded and patronised by Ghdikani
lilsMhcfl tknOf a landed magnate. The poet who fiou^ed under
Ijife pattoncge wa» Vangori Subba Rao. Subba Kao started a
 156                               mSTORY OF YELUOU LITftllS^TUFE

  Telugu fortnightly journal Vasundharat in 1915 and wrote a
   History of Telugu Literature, a critical biograjpJiy of Vemana,
  and an account of Sataka poets. They are interesting books and
   though not very authoritative or comprehensive, they contain
   useful material for reference.     ,
     Sakiti Samiti which had its start at Tenali during 1918—1919
  has rendered yeoman service to the growth of Telugu Literature
  on modern lines. It was sponsored by Tallavajjhala Sivasankara
  Sastri (now Siva Sankara Swami) and his comrade Nori Nara-
  simha Sastri. It gained ®rapid momemtum when Chinta Bhima
  Sankaram, Chinta Dikshitulu, Kodavatiganti Venkata Subbayya,
  Tripuraribhatla Viraraghava Swami, Peddibhatla Puma Sarma,
  Vajjhala Babu Rao, Kommuri Hanumanta Rao, Kopalle Siva
  Kameswara Rao, Munimanikyam Narasimha Rao, Peddibhatla
  Ramachandra Rao, Chamarti Rajasekhara Rao and Komanduti
  Krishnamacharyulu became members of the Samiti. In 1920
  their journal Sahiti was published. Later on some more members
 joined the Samiti among whom were Devulapalli Krishna Sastri,
 Vedula Satyanarayana Sastri, Mokkapati Narasimha Sastri,
 Visvanatha Satyanarayana, Kodali Anjaneyulu, Nanduri Venkata
 Subba Rao, Nayani Subba Rao, Srinivasa Siromani and others.
 Ramamurti, the sponsor of the Modem Telugu movement, was
 next invited to be an honorary member. A little later, Panchagnula
 Adinarayana Sastri, Adavi Bapiraju, Rayaprolu Subba Rao and
 Kuruganti Sitarama Bhattacharya also became members. Every
 one of these members had already made a name as a distinguished
 writer. Siva Sankara Sastri was the editor of the journal, Sahiti.
 It helped the spread of the modem Telugu movement in the
 country. Though almost all the members had been using the
 classical dialect in their writings, they advocated the use of the
living dialect and began to use particularly for prose. The journal
provided a forum for all branches of modem literature. The
writings of Gurazada Appa Rao and Rayaprolu Subba Rao
inspired the younger writers.
    A short biographical sketch of the leading members ^ this Samiti
will enable the readers to appreciate the growth of modem Telugu
literature. The Samiti was in fact a training ground for many
writers of this century. Almost all the members of thi$
particularly the juniors—submitted their writings to Tallavfjjhala
Siva Sankara Sastri for his revision. All % them held Sastri In
 uMAw iNsrmmoNS                                                    157
 high esteem and regarded him as their "cider brother” and
 SahhapaH*
    Tallavajjhala Siva Sankara Sastri (1892) was born in a family
 known for scholarship in Sanskrit for several generations. His father-
 in-law was Neti Subbaraya Sastri, a great Sanskrit scholar. He
 had therefore, the good fortune of growing up in an atmosphere
 of culture. He commenced writing in 1911—1912. He learnt
 Bengali and Hindi and desired to translate into Telugu the best
 books in those languages. That was the age of novels. His
 novels were Jivana Prabhatam               , Madhavikankanam (1918)
Kanchanamala (1923) Kunkuma Bharani (1926). Among his poetic
compositions, Hridayesvari—a romantic poem (1925) is the most
celebrated. It won for him the appreciation of a wide public.
His Auedana (1929) is charged with deep emotion and gives poetic
form to his varied experiences. He was particularly fond of
writing all verse dramas {padya and Geyanatikalu) with themes
based on ancient history and legend. His translations of Kathasarit
S agar a from Sanskrit and of the Jataka stories from Pali aie in the
standard modern Telugu.
   He is a noted linguist, proficient in Sanskrit, Telugu and English.
He is well-versed in Bengali and Hindi and has some acquaintance
with Urdu and Marathi. He is interested in the Sastrasy including
Silpa. With regard to the style to be used in writing Telugu
prose, he is of the view that what is more important is the thought,
which must be elevated and invigorating—similar to what is
said by Rajasekhara Kavi—" Utti bise sho kalloj bhasha ja hodu sa
hodu   ”,
   Nori Narasimha Sastri (1900) was, like Siva Sankara Sastri,
brought up in a family of Sanskrit and Telugu scholars. His
father Hanumachchastri and his uncle Gurulinga Sastri were
eminent pandits. Narasimha Sastri could, therefore, acquire a
good knowledge of both Sanskrit and Telugu in his early years.
His study of English literature encouraged him to follow the new
trends in Telugu literature and his close association with Siva
Sankara Sastri had a beneficient influence on him. Even while
he was a student at College, he started lAnriting poems and stories.
His Gitamalika (1921) was a collection of short poems; BhagavatO’-
OiUarmam (1923) was a playlet in verse and Somanatka Vijajiam
(1923) a play in prose with the destruction of the Temple of Soma-
nath for its theme. His novels ^Pfofcyana Bhattu, Rudrmit Dm,
 158                                HISTORY Of TSLUOU lOTBRaiVlUS

 Vakira and Malta Reddi written in recent years are based on
 historical incidents and they reveal 'his knowl^ge of Andhra
 history and his ability to recapture the past. Of these novels
 J^arayana BhaXiu won him the State award (1949—50) through
 the Telugu Bhasha Samiti, Madras. He is now engaged in
  translating Dem Bhagavatam as a mahakavya*
     Ghinta Dikshitulu (1891—1960) was one of the earliest short story
 writers. His Ekadast (1925) is a collection of eleven short stories
 of outstanding merit. Later on, he published several stories under
 the caption of Dikshttula^ Kathalu (stc^ries of Dikshitulu), Vatvav
 Kathalu and Hasya Kathalu (stories of fun and frolic). His Ldkka
 Pidatalu and Lila Sundari, a fairy tale, are very popular among
 children.
     Tripuraribhatla Viraraghava Swami (1892) is a great
 scholar with proficiency in Sanskrit and Telugu and well-versed
 in Metaphysics, Poetics and Astronomy. He learnt Bengali and
published Kapala Kundala (1922) a translation of a Bengali novel.
    Vedula Satyanarayana Sastri (1900) was in his early years a
student of Sripada Krishnamurti Sastri, late poet-laureate of
 Andhra Pradesh. His poetry teems with conflicting emotions
and feelings. He is essentially a poet of romantic love. His
Dipaoali is a collection of lyrical poems, exquisite in language and
deeply moving in sentiment. He is called by his admirers,
Gautami Kokila (the cuckoo of the Gautami or Godavari river).
    Devulapalli Krishna Sastri (1897) was bom in a family of
pandits and poets. In his early years he was brought up in a
scholarly environment, and listened to the discourses and disputa¬
tions of the Devulapalli brothers, the younger of whom was his
father. In his college days he came under the influence of the
late R. Venkataratnam Naidu, Principal of the College at
Kaldnada, whose memory is reverenced as that of a great English
scholar and orator, a humanitarian and social reformer. The
study of English literature, especially of the Romantic period, the
Dawn of new ideals expressed through new trends in 'l^elugu
literature, and the short lyrics of Gurazada Appa Rao^and Raya^
prolu Subba Rao inspired Krishna Sastri in his coUqce deys to
ooimpose lyrics, which w'cre remarkable for beauty of style and
sentiment. Krishna Paksham (1925) and Gnmi (1929), two collected
volumes of his lyrical poems, are his masteropieces. His potuda '
ase tinged with melancholy and despondexfty expressive of dliS
 mwast saaawmoNB                                                m
  agony of his soul, while his speeches are enlrvening and fuU q|
 gentle humour. His songs are melodious and appe^iz^. He is
 justly regarded as one of the sweetest poets in Andhra Pradesh.
 His introductions to Ekanta Seva composed by Venkata Parvatisvara
 ikavulu is a fine specimen of prose in modern Telugu.
    Nanduri Venkata Subba Rao (1895—1958) was a grea;t trans*
 grcssor of the age-old canons of grammar and poetics. In his
 songs—Tenkt Pataht—he used the spoken dialect of the peasant
 class to which his hero, Nayudu hava^ and heroine, Tetddf belonged.
  tedd was depicted as an incarnatvn pf innocence, purity and
 •implicity; and J^ayudubava, as an embodiment of sincerity, virtue
 and tenderness. They were like Venus and Adonis or as Romeo
 and Juliet, and their love, though human, had a touch of the
 Divine. The author could sing his songs marvellously and«
 entertain the cultured classes as well as the common folk. Vedara
 Venkataraya Sastri who was opposed to the use of the spoken
language for serious composition—prose or poetry^listened tp
his recital with rapturous surprise, embraced him with cordiality,
 and expressed his good wishes. The songs were later set to music
axud simg in radio programmes of light music. Some of them are
today sung as the theme for dance and abhtnaya, like the songs
oflS^etrajna.
    Viavanatha Satyanarayana (1895) is known for his versatile
scholarship and poetic talent. He is a prolific writer who usa
his facile pm for varied literary patterns, major and minor poems,
novels and short stories; plays and playlets; and sketches and
essays. His patriotic poems, Andhra PrasasH and Andhra Pemusham
are popular and frequently recited at meetings. His songs,
Mimurasani Patalu and Kohlamma Pendli, are moving in their lyricism.
His elegiac poem Varalakshmi trisaH expresses his lamentation
fin: his deceased wife in elegant literary style. His earlier short
poems Akasadiptm and Visvami^rwktrMenaka are evidence of his
  trong individuality and vigorised style. He creates new poetic
oonventions, some of which are interest ng.
    Of his novels, V^adagalu (thousand hoods) shared the award
vMi Bapii^u’f Jifarqifana Mat in a competition held by the Andhre
University j his Cheliyali Katta is a praise-worthy novd. Of hit

in which the character of Uttara is depicted charmingly is some*
times enacted on the stage with success.             **
    His language is high-flown, and sometimes his poetry is burdened
with Sanskrit compounds and out of the way expressions which
obscure his thoughts or render it difficult to comprehend them.
His style is not uniform; it becomes frequently stilted and pathetic.
But these peculiarities have not stood in the way of his recognition
as a first-rate man of letters in the modem age.
    The Telugu Literary Association (1913—26) and the Bharati
 Tirtha (1926) at Vizianagarrm rendered great sei vices to revive
the waning glory of Telugu culture and promote the modem
trends in Telugu literature. Burra Seshagiri Rao and O. P.
Ramamurti were the sponsors of both these institutions, the former
being the more active member by virtue of his influence and
popularity as professoi of English in the Maharaja’s College at
Vizianagaram. Bhogarazu Narayana Murti and Adidam Rama
Rao and some others helped the organization. Narayana Murti
had already won a name as the author of Vimaladevi a novel,
published by the Vtjnana Chandrtka Mandali; he had also published
some poems of which Panduga Katnam (the festive present) became
very popular in those days. Adidam Rama Rao was a great
scholar who collected the forgotten accounts of the past Kalinga
Telugu poets. The Bharati Tirtha was holding annual conferencea
from 1926 to 1940 which attracted poets and scholars from distant
places. Eminent scholars like Gidugu Ramamurti, Achanta
Venkata Rao (Sankhyayana Sarma), the Maharaja of Parlakimidi
and the Maharaja Vikrama Deo of Jeypore presided over the
conferences. The conference was held for four or five days.
Scholars read their learned essays relating to Telugu language
and literature and poets recited their poems. Prizes and oriental
titles were awarded at the conferences to the deserving scholars.
    Burra Seshagiri Rao (1884—1940) was a great scholar of Telugu
as well as of English. He was the first Telugu Reader of the
University of Madras, when the language research branches were
opened in 1914. He was the author of Bobbili Matakam in which
he defended the action of Vijayaramaraju who is generally accused
of tfeachcrous intrigue with Bussy in 1756—7. He also contributed
several articles in Telugu on subjects relating to Telugu language
and literature. He assisted Ramamurti and Appa Rao in pro¬
moting the cause of modem Telugu. *

    The Telugu Bhashahhivardhani and Vegujukka Granthamaia
at Berhampore (1913) were very active for about twenty years;
and they have been doing service to promote the development of
modern literature in Telugu. Devarazu Venkata Krishna Rao,
the heart and soul of the literary activity of those days, was the
author of some novels like Vade Vidu but he won a name in Telugu
literature by his Sri Krishna Rayaharam (Krishna’s message).
   Tapi Dharma Rao (1887) was the leader of the literary coterie
of Berhampore when he was a lecturer in Klathematic s in the
Khallikota college (1913—1916). He Jiad a chequered career,
but has been all along rendering service to promote scholarship
and modern literature. As editor of Jana Vani, a Telugu Daily,
he proved himself an able journalist. There were several literary
associations started or encouraged by him. Ragi Dabbu, Dyoya-
namUi Bhikshapatraniy Andhratejam are among his poetic contributions.
 Ushah KalamUy and Krovvu rallu are his novels. Vilasarjuniyamu and,
 Taptasrukanamu are his dramas. He is also the author of many
essays on literary and cultural topics. His Parijatapaharana
Bhavaprakasika is a scholarly conunentary on the classical poem
of Timmana, and he has also written a similar commentary on
 Vijayavilasam of Chemakura Venkata Kavi.
   Anantapantula Ramalingasvami is a talented poet with an
aptitude for tinging his expressions with humour and satire. His
Suklapaksham contains story poems with descriptions of hilarious
and valiant exploits. It is so named as to suggest that while
Devulapalli Krishna Sastri presented Krishnapakshaniy the dark
fortnight, he would present Suklapakshamy the bright fortnight.
   Mandapaka Parvatisvarakavi (1890—1938) was the grandson
of the great scholarly poet of the same name mentioned in the
previous section. He acquired proficiency in Telugu and Sanskrit
and contributed several poems to Vegu-Jukka at Berhampore and
to thO other leading Telugu journals like the Bharati.
   Jdavya Sahitya Panshad (1933): By 1932, hundreds of writers
advocated the modern Telugu movement and many of them used
the living language in their writings which represented almost
all the trends of modem Telugu literature. The need for a wider
and. iporje comprehensive institution than the Sakiti Smiti was
feiti to- bring together all these modem writers. A prelimiiiary
conference of aU such writers under the name of MMnaoandUira
Kam pandila nu^ sabha was hdd at Berhampore, Gaiyam District
     n

 (then a part of Madras Presidency). Dr. Ghilukuri Narayana
 Rao, presided over the conference. It was thezf decided to
constitute the Navya Sahitya Parishad with its headquarters at
 Guntur. The second conference was held in December 1933 at
Rajahmundry under the presidentship of Rayaprolu Subba Rao.
That was the occasion for the celebration of the 71st birthday of
Gidugu Ramamurti. The Parishad then presented to him all his
works, which it had printed and published in four volumes, along
with a Commemoration volume containing articles in Englidi
and Telugu by other scholars.
    In 1936 the Parishad started a quarterly magazine known as
Pratibha in which it published articles by modern Telugu writers,
which represented almost all the new patterns of literature. Talla-
vajjhala Siva Sankara Sastri then populaily known as Sabhapati
was the principal organiser of this Parishad, Telikicherla
Venkataratnam has been from the beginning not only the Secretary
of the Parishad but also the heart and soul of the institution as well
as the n^gazii>e.
   Immense service was rendered by a great oriental scholar,
Panchagnula Adinarayana Sastri and many others to the successlu}
beginning and the subsequent development of the Parishad and
Pratibha,
   Kaoita Samiti (1934) was another Association intended to
foster modem literature in Telugu. Marepalli Ramachandra
Sastri (1873—1948) was the guru and the source of inspiration to
the young writers of the Visakhapatnam District. With him as
the president, this institution was started at Visakhapatnam by
his pupils and admirers. Ramachandra Sastri planned a
comprehensive Telugu Grammar with Telugu technical terms
and a Telugu Lexicon known as Telugu Nudikadali (meaning
ocean of words) and commenced both very late in his life. Ke
died in 1948 without making any good progress in either of them.
Among his disciples, Gobburi Venkata Ananda Raghava Rao,
author of the History of Telugu prose and biographies xd
great scientists, wrote several lengthy articles on the ^tronomieal
interpretatioii of Vedic hymns. Puripanda Appalasvami is a
good Telugu scholar though his mother-tongue is Oriya. He halw.
 publiidied the MMbharata in popular Telugu prose; and he

 stories by Khasim Khan and a hand-book of Telugu literature
  (in English) as well as Jiavyandkra Sahitya Vidhulu (New ways in
  Telugu literature) by Kuruganti Sitarama Bhattacharyulu.
     Andhra Sarasvata Parishady Hyderabad (1949) has beome the
 centie of activity for the growth of Telugu literature and the
 spread of liberal education with 18(k branches in Telengana and
 elsewhere. Devulapalli Ramanuja Rao, Pulijala Hanumanta
 Rao, Parsa Venkatesvara Rao and Narottama Reddi have been
 the active members of the Pariskad and they had the co-operation
 of friends like Burgula Ranganatha Rao, Bhaskarabhatla Krishna
 Rao, Biduru Venkata Seshayya and Sankara Narayana Rao and
 the support of Madapati Hanumanta Rao (the then mayor of
 Hyderabad), Burgula Rama Krishna Rao, ex-govemor of U.P.,
 Bukkapatnam Ramanujacharya and Suravaram Pratapa Reddi
 whose Andhrula Sanghika Chantra published by the Partshad won the
 posthumous award of Rs. 5,000 offered by the Sahitya Akademi.
    Among the writers of Telangana, connected with the literary
associations in this region were also Kaloji Narayana Rao (1914),
 a staunch nationalist who composed a poem to express his indigna¬
tion at the terrorism that raged in Hyderabad before the police
aetbn. Dharanikota Srinivasulu is regarded as the Munimanikyam
of Telangana for his humorous and domestic stories. T. Ramanja-
neyulu is famous for his inspiring Burra Kathas. Bhagi Narayana
Murti (1912) is a musician actor and play-wright. Burgula
Ranganatha Rao (1917), Illindala Sarasvati Devi (1919) and Nelluri
Kesavasvami (1920) are good writers of short stoiies. Vcldurti

    The Progressioe Writers’ Association (1943) at Vijayawada,
though its work was for a time interrupted by the political aciKities
 of its Communist members, has done good service to the progress
of modem literature in Telugu. The literal> activities of its
members have pi od need a gieat awakening in the country. It
 could attract even the judges of the Madias High Court, P. V.
Rajamannar and V. Govindarajathaii, to preside over the literaly
sessions of a confeienc^ held at Madras in 1947. It claims
K. Viresalingam, Guruzada Appa Rao, Gidugu Ramamuiti,
Komarrazu Lakshmana Rao and Kasinadhuni Nagesvaia Rao
as promoters of its progressive ahhyudqya creed in the literary
field and founders of the new age in literature.
    Very useful books have been published in the name of
Visalandhra publications such as Andhra Darsini as an annual or
periodical Directory since 1954, a comprehensive book of informa¬
tion relating to the history, language, literatuie and the various
cultural aspects of the Telugu countiy.
    Among the active members of the literary field were one Kundurti
Anjaneyulu (1922); one of the Nayagara (aggressive) poets, Narla
Chiranjivi (1925) who has written stimulating short stories and
playlets for children; Ayala Somayajula Narasimha Sarma (1923)
a Sanskrit and Telugu scholar, author of literary essays and short

    Among the more prominent progressive writers are: Srirangam
 Srinivasa Rao, popularly known as Sri Sri, (1910) is a close student
 of English literature and modem developments in Russian ideology.
 He possesses a strong individuality and has produced “revolu¬
 tionary ** poetry; he looks ahead of his times and visualises a brave
 new world. Theme, thought and expression are all his own.
 His Prabhava and Mahaprasthanam are widely read and appreciated.
    Srirangam Narayana Babu (1916) has composed short poems
 depicting hunger and affliction among the poor and the miserable
 life of the destitutes in society.
    There are eminent authors that do not belong to any of the
 literary associations mentioned above.

     Pingali Lakshmikantam (1894) and Katuri Venkateswara Rao
  (1895—1962) good scholars of Teliigu, Sanskrit and English, are
  twin poets, closely associated as the joint authors of the renowned
 poems, viz., Tolakari and Saundaranandanam. Of these, Tolakari
  meaning “ early showers ” is ? collection of their short poems,
  and the name suggests that tliey were their early compositions.
 They are beautiful lyrics which waken an emotional response
 from the readers. Dr. C. R. Rcddi appreciated their poetic
 talent in his preface to Tolakari. With their Saundaranandanam,
 their fame was well established. It is a*lengthy poem relating to
 the legend of Buddha’s younger step-brother, Nanda, and his
 devoted wife Sundari. The theme is from Asvaghosha’s poem;
 but it is neither a translation nor an adaptation of that poem.
 It shows their superb skill in depicting the emotional experience
•of the hero and the heroine, and the gradual sublimation of their
 aesthetic love into spiritual devotion, as the result of the Buddha’s
 precept and example. It had the genuine appreciation of the
 first Andhra Poet-laureate, Chellapilla Venkata Sastri, their guru
 to whom they dedicated the poem.
    Paulasiya Hridayam by Katuri Venkateswara Rao is comparatively
a shorter poem, relating to the soft corner in the heart of Ravana,
 as a devotee of Rama. This idealistic conception of the brighter
side of Ravana is very elevating, and the theme is handled with
the utmost tenderness. Venkateswara Rao translated some
dramas of Bhasa, and wrote literary essays.
    Lakshmikantam has written scholarly reviews and introductions
to ancient classics such as Ranganatha Ramayanamu, and Dvipada
Bharatamu, He translated Gangalahari and some other poems of
Jagannatha and also published a volume of critical essays under
the title Gautama Vyasamulu.
    Duwuri Rami Rcddi (1895—1949) though not an agriculturist
himself, was born and brought up amidst rural surroundings and
traditions. By intense study, and the acquisition of modern
culture, he could develop his innate poetic talent to commendable
heights. Erom his autobiographical notes we learn that he could
compose good Telugu verse by 1915. Though he used the
rlftiwiral dialect for his poetry, he transgressed the old rules of
grammar wherever such transgression improved the even flow of
the verse. He used to condemn the critics that were devoted to
traditional canons of poesy, and once said that the creator deprived
  166                                HISTORY OP TELUOU UTERATUSB

   them of the sense of sympathy and of appreciation|^ and sweetness
   and tenderae&s of heart.
     Rami Reddi acquired a good knowledge of Sanskrit and
  translated into Telugu verse Kalidasa’s Rtiusamharam and Pushpa^
  bana-vilasam. He learnt also Persian and translated the Rubaiyat
  of Omar Khayam under the title Pana Sala.
     More interesting than these translations are his original poems,
  some of which ate of the type of folk-songs. He could describe
  rural life in an attractive poetic style. In one of his short poems,
  he gave an admirable sketch of an old woman who had lost her
  children and suflercd from abject poverty, but did not like to be
  a beggar and therefore toiled for her bread. By 1921 he was so
  inspired by the nationalistic movement that he turned his pen
  to compose the Gharka song and other nationalistic short poems.
  But his Krtshivaludu was his master-piece. Dr. C. R. Reddi,
 appreciating this poem said that the poet had presented a beautiful
 sketch of the cultivators’ life and of the intimate relationship
 between physical nature and human nature.
     During 1925—1930 he was bereaved of his loving wife and
 children and his mind was so dejected that he could not produce
 expressing joy. His Bhagna hridayudu (the broken hearted) belongs
 to this period of suffering. Rami Reddi was too emotional to
 submit to unhappiness like a stoic. In one place, he says, addressing
 his deceased wife, “ you stole my heart, steal my memory too ”.
     His second wife consoled him and helped him to recover his
 optimism. His Paiita Kesam (Grey hairs) exhibits perfection in
 thought and style.
    Kavikondala Venkata Rao (1892) is a prolific writer. As
 Visvanatha Salyanarayana once observed, “ he used his pen in
 all directions; his poems exhibit keen observation of nature and
 poetic skill, though there is a tinge of the Godavari rural dialect **.
    He is a minstrel with ability to sing the Bobbili Ballad like
professional singers. He has composed many short poems of the
type of folk-songs like Kalarutam, Kumara kantham, KonerUy Vifira-^
sandesam, etc. His poems are partly pastoral and partly' lyrical*
    Gurram Joshuva (1895): Though a Christian, he has been
brought up amidst Hindu traditions and culture. He acquit^
a good knowledge of Telugu language and literature and servtKi
as a Telugu pandit in a High school in Vinulq^nda, Guntur IJisttict*
lie is a prolific writer with more than 24 works to his credit. .

 Among his poems, Firdousit GcAbilam (bat), Svapna Kathat Mumtaz
 mahal are interesting and enlivening. He has also written some
 dramas like Rukmini kidyanam, Tera chatu (behind the curtain)
 and Mirabau His admirers honoured him with Ganda Penderam
 (Grolden anklet to his foot) as a mark of eminence in poetic art.
    Ganti Jogi Somayaji (1900) has acquired proficiency in Sanskrit,
 Telugu and English and knows some other Indian languages.
 His early writings are Basava Charitra (1925) poem, Ramachandruni
 Hampi yatra {\93G) inspired by Byron’s Childe Harold, Dravida
 Bhashalti a comparative study, And^a Bhashavikasam (the develop¬
 ment of Telugu).
    Korada Ramakrishnayya (1891—1961) is a good scholar of
 Sanskrit, Telugu and English. In his early years he composed
 short poems with patriotic themes. But his talent is exhibited
 more in the field of Telugu linguistic studies, poetics, and literary
criticism. He was the author of Andhra Bharata Kavitavimarsamu,
 Kalidasuni kavita pratibha and literary essays. He read several
scholarly essays at the sessions of the All India Oriental Conferences*
Sandhif Dravidian Philology, Dravidian Cognates are among his
 works of importance.
    Nidadavolu Venkata Rao (1904) is a good scholar of Telugu
and English. He is a prolific writer. He has written introduce
tions or editorial prefaces to several classical w'orks printed during
the last fifteen years. Among his poetic compositions, MinchupalH
 Telugupolupu is the best; it relates to the ideal life in villages. Ho •
is the author of Telugu Kavula Charitra and the DaksMna Desiyandkra
 VangmayamUf both hi^dras University publications; Udakarana
 Vangmayamu with particular reference to Tripurantakodaharanam.
   Adivi Bapirazu (1895—1952); A lover of beauty and melody
from his childhood, Bapirazu began to compose short poems and
draw pictures even as a boy. As a student of the Rajahmundry
College, he derived inspiration from his Guru and his life-long
friend, Principal Couldrey, an Oxford scholar and himself a “WTiter
of stories in English and a painter with a keen appreciation of
ancient Indian painting and sculpture. Tolakari was one of his
maiden productions during his teens. Highly emotional by
nature, he was a loving friend and associate of KavUcondala
Venkata Rao and later, of the rising poets of the Romantic school.
Bapirazu developed the art of drawing beautiful sketches to
Slustrate his own poems. He could recite his compositions very
 168                                 HISTORY OF TBLUOU UTERATURB

  melodiously. They are occasionally broadcast from the Radio
  stations, “ His Master’s Voice ” has records of somlfe of his poems
  and songs as rendered by musicians. Bapirazu had an eye for
  what was beautiful and uplifting and his poems reflect his heart
  and soul. Sasikala, published po^humously on the 1st January
   1954, was a collection of 72 poems and songs. Sasikala is so named
  because the author had in his mind Selene, the goddess of the
  moon who caresses End>mion, a beautiful young man (in Greek
  mythology), while he slept. Bapirazu as a student, admired
  Keat’s poem and was inspired to compose a song on Endymion
  in Tclugu which appears as the 60th in Sasikala, An interesting
  memento of this poem is a beautiful drawing by Prof. Couldrey
  which shows Bapirazu sleeping in the Ajanta valley—probably
  to be kissed by his Sasikala*
     Bapirazu also wrote short stories, viz., Anjali, Ragamalika and
   Tarangini^ in all of which one can sense the author’s love of the
  beautiful and his rich emotional nature. He also wrote novels—
  Narudu (man) and Marayanarao, both of which are social. In
  JVarayanarao the author displays his knowledge of many branches
  of learning—literature, painting, music, dancing, archaeology,
  medicine, etc. He used the characters of his novels as mouth¬
  pieces for the expression of his ijeisonal views and tastes. These
  passages are sometimes, too long and dilatory and interfere with
  the progress of the story.
.    Basavarazu Appa Rao (1894—1933): During his short life,
  he rose to eminence as a composer of lyrical poems and songs.
  He battled against adversity and frustration of hope but
  developed an optimistic outlook. His great wish was onc<?
  expressed in a couplet:—

       Pata padu-t-undaga na prani eguna?
       Prani dati egu-t-unda pata nota moguna?

   It means—
      Ohl will my life expire as I sing my song?
      Or my song be heard as life expires?

His wish was fulfllled.    That is what happened.

   Dtgavalli Venkata Siva Rao, a scholar and fwriter published

  a volume of his songs, only after Appa Rao died. Among his
  songs, some are on the lips of many young men and girls, such as
  Gutti vankaya kuroi bam in which the sportive girl addresses her
  cousin and says “ I have prepared a brinjal curry, and for spices
  I crammed it with my love for you         The other stanzas contain
 similar sentiments of love. Some songs like nalla vade golla pilla
 Dade referred to boy Krishna, the dark coloured boy of cowherds,
 ontiga~n~uyyala-l~ugitiva? Krishna I*’ (—^swinging all alone? O
 Krishna),Mamidikommanu allukonnadi madhavi lata okati (the Malati
 creeper has entwined itself round the mango tiee) etc., have been
 very freely used by the film producers in Andhra. They are
 melodious even when they are only read out and not sung. The
 language is itself mellifluous and its sweetness is enhaneed by the
 choice expression of the poet. His Selayeti ganam (the music of
 the rivulet) shows the influence of Guruzada Appa Rao’s poetry
on him—in language, form and treatment. Of his patriotic and
 nationalistic songs, the most popular refers to his adoration of
 Mahatma Gandhi. He used to write only when the inspiration
and the numbers came to him.
    Rallapalli Ananta Krishna Sarma (1893) studied Sanskrit and
 Prakrit grammais and poetics and acquired pioficiency in Telugu
literature. He became an adept in music also. After retirement
from service in Mysoie, he \\ as employed by the Oriental Institute
of Research at Tirupati, and in a few years he became an edi¬
 tor of Annamacharya’s songs. He is a sweet warbler in the two
fields of Sahitya and Sangita, and his speech is equally melodious
and charming. His Sami puja and Penugonda pata arc simple and
sweet; they are always read o\er and over again with sustained
interest. Tara devi and Mira hai are his other poetic compositions
that deserve the appreciation of the readers. Salivahana Saptasati
is a translation of Hala’s Prakrit verses. He has won greater
fame as a good prose writer.        His essays on Drama are worth
studying by all lovers of dramatic art. His essays on Rayalanati~
rasikata show his critical study of Amukta malyada and other classics
of the tin\5 of Krishnadevaraya. His review of Vemana is a model
for literary appreciation and criticism.      It is a delight to listen
to his demonstration of Annamacharya’s songs which he set to
musici
  Gadiyaram Venkatasesha Sastri (1897) started his literary

 historical and puranic; prose, essays and biographies. Of his
 poems there are short poems of one hundred and odd verses and
 lengthy poems of the kavya type of several thousand verses, most
 of which arc translations from Sanskrit. He has a facile pen and
 composes with rapidity. Generally his original draft could be
  the press copy. The most admirable literary feat which he
 accomplished is the translation of the Mahabharata^ the Bhagavata
 and the Ramayana once again—all single-handed, while each of
 these had required the collaboration of three or more for comple¬
 tion, when they were translated in the previous centuries. His plea
 for another version of these epics was that the first was not a true
 but free translation of the original Sanskrit. It is the opinion of
 several scholars that his translation is in some respects better than
 Tikkana’s though felicity of expression is wanting in Sastri’s
 translation. Srikrishna Bhaiatam is so named because it suggests
 that the author of this Telugu version is Krishnamurti Sastri.
 In translating the Bhagavata again he says that Potana was unfair
 to Sri Krishna by making him ajara (profligate), chora (thief) but
his translation docs not possess the melody and poetic art of Potana.
He wrote some -other lengthy poems such as Ganesa Puranam.
    Of his minor poems, some are satirical, and some are in the
so-called pure Telugu. He also performed the strange feat of
composing a poem with only eleven letters of the Telugu alphabet.
Among his original works, Madkukara Vijqyam is most interesting.
It reads like a novel in verse like Kalapumodayam by Pingali Surana
of the last part of the sixteenth century.
    Of his dramas, Bobbiliyuddham^ a historical^ drama relating to
the battle at Bobbil j (1757) is the best and is frequently staged*
LITERARY INSTITUTIONS                                          173

Kdabhashini is based on a theme from Kalapurnodayam, Of his
prose worb, Tmali Ramakrishna Chantam is the best.
  He was awarded titles; at various stages of his literary career.
He has been acclaimed as    Ahhimva Srinotha^ which suggests that
his poetry has the merits of Srinatha’s compositions.
  He has been also a journalist.     His  Gautami (1908) was the
first Telugu Daily. He held for a lime his Vojrayudha (thunderbolt)
with which he wanted to smite the Modern Telugu movement;
Imt he put it away when hejrcaliscd tliat his weapon had been
rendered powerless like a Papal B&Il 41 a Protestant State.

        New Trends in Modern Literature:Poetry
                     (a) Romantic and lyrical poems

The    new     trends in Telugu literature, owe their origin and
 development to the influence of English literature. While scholars
 of Sanskrit and Telugu, unacquainted with English, followed the
 time-lionouied models and pioduccd litciature with the same
 old themes, the English educated Telugus, like theii contemporaries
 in other linguistic regions of India, experimented with new patterns
 of literary expiession.
    Viresalingam may be regarded as the founder of this new school,
though he did not give up the accepted style of prose writing in
his novels and other works. He wrote books which represented
almost dll the new patterns of this age—novel, story, drama, farce,
essay, short poems, biography, auto-biography, literary criticism
and Lives of Telugu poets. He used the kavya dialect for poetry
and prose, but in the case of prose, the language used by him is
very simple and free from obsolete or obsolescent forms and words,
and in the case of farces (prahasanas) he used the spoken tongue
of the characters in the story (dramatis personae).
   In the field of poetry, many students of High School and College
classes used to compose short poems, either original or translations
of English poems. For example, I composed Telugu verses in
praise of Queen Victoria on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee
in 1897 in collaboration with my friend, Burra Seshagiri Rao;
but they arc not worth recording or even mentioning, though we
were then awarded prizes. My translation of “ Lord UUin’s
Daughter** composed in 1905 was later published in Zenana
Patrika edited by Rayasam Venkata Sivudu. There were in those
days more brilliant students who could compose much better
short poems. Dr. C. Ramalinga Reddi composed in 1900 a poem
known as Musalamma Maranam based on a traditional story of
Anantapur which won him the college prize while yet a student
of the Christian College. A. Ramachandrawao Naidu translated

                                 174

 Tennyson’s ** Dora ” as a short poem in pure TelugUs while he
 was a student of the F.A. class in the same college in 1902.
    Achanta Sankhyayana Sarma composed in 1904 an original
lyrical poem, known as Chandamama (moon) and it was published
 in 1905 in Sarawah, a Tclugu monthly edited by K. R. V. ELrishna
 Rao at Kakinada. Sarma was one of the earliest to compose
 lyrical poems. There were many more poets who composed
short poems, in the first decade of this century.
    All these poems were composed in the Kavya dialect, but they
did not dwell long in the memory of th^ reading public, nor were
they much appreciated in those early days either by classicists
or by modernists.
   In course of time, however, there arose two poets who exercised
great influence on the modem poets of this age, viz., Gurazada
Venkata Appa Rao and Rayaprolu Subba Rao. There was, for
some years, an interesting controversy in liteiary circles. The
points at issue were, which of the two was the earliest to start the
new trends in modem Tclugu poetry, and which of them exerted
greater influence on the rising poets of the age. In respect of age,
literary standing and culture, it is very clear that Appa Rao, who
was bom in 1861 and composed several verse-stories during his
college days and published his first edition of Kanyasulkam in 1897
and the second (revised and enlarged) edition in 1909, was by
far the senior of the two. But the admirers of Rayaprolu maintain
that Rayaprolu’s Tclugu poems were earlier at least by a few
months, and their influence on the young poets was also greater.
The indisputable fact is that both of them wrote independently
of each other. In the matter of influencing subsequent writers,
there is some truth in the contention that Subba Rao’s Trina^
kahkanam (The Bracelet of Grass) though composed in 1912, two
years after Appa Rao composed his Mutyala Saramulu inspired the
younger poets more rapidly than Appa Rao’s writings. That
was a time when the glamour for the poetic dialect of the classic
writers was still predominant. Subba Rao’s style maintained the
standarc^of the classical language though he violated the rules of
old grammar for achieving more grace, while Appa Rao wrote
in the living language, flavoured with some expressions of poetic
diction. Rayaprolu’s poetry was imiversally appreciated) and
the appreciation of Appa Rao’s poetry was limited* In course
of time) with the awakening of political, social and cpltural
 176                               HISTORY OF TELUGU UTERATOBB

 consciousness in the country, Appa Rao came to be hailed as one
of the Tu^akartas of the modern age, by virtue of4iis popular social
 drama, Kanyasulkam and the cosmopolitan and egalitarian ideals
extrolled in his songj, poems and diaraas. The indisputable fact
is that Rayapiolu’s p(»etry is uniformly sweet and beautiful in
sentiment, and Appa Rao’s poems and songs display greater
vigour and majestv of thought. There is also a wide mcasuie of
agreement that Gurazada’s influence was moie powerful over
the song-writers like Nanduri Subba Rao, Basavaraju Appa Rao
and Adivi Bapirazu, while Rayapiolu was definitely the precursor
and inspirer of the Bhava-kavis like Krishna Sastri, Nayani Subba
Rao, Visvanatha and Mallavaiapu Visvcsvaia Rao. These
features will be elaborated in the next section. I shall here present
a brief sketch of their life and literary activities.
   Gurazada Venkata Appa Rao (1861—1915) was brought up
in an atmosphere of occidental as well as Oriental scholarship at
Vizianagaram as a result of which he developed in his early years
a taste for liberal culture and the fine arts. He had love enough
for his country, but warned himself and his friends against narrow
parochialism. His poems illustrate his ideals; the real love which
one should have for one’s own country is expressed in his DesabhakU
which means—

       Bl6w not thy trumpet indiscreet;
           ** I love my country sweet ”
       Do thou and show a deed renowned
           Give up thy bragging sound;
       From gain of thine allot thy mite
           To help thy neighbour’s plight;
       By country is meant not earth, not mud.
           But men of flesh and blood.
       Look not behind to praise the past
           Its best is little, not vast;
       Bereft of sloth, go on apace,
           A lag is down in race.

  In Mutyala Saramulu (garlands of pearls) which contains his
musings about life and progress, he sings that if all the world be
one house and all distinctions based on colour are effaced, the
love that transcends all diflferences will &ower joy abounding.
 MBW TREm>8 ; POBTRY                                           17^

  warring religious creeds will vanish and knowledge alone shine
  in splendour and the Bliss of Heaven enrich all lands. In his
  Lavanarazu kala (dream) the hero says: Among men there are just
  two castes — the good and the bad — and if the good are ‘ un¬
  touchable*, I should love to be one among them.** In his Kanya,
 a Vaiy>a maiden who sacrificed her life to protect her modesty
 from being outraged by a king, Appa Rao says, “Fame and
 disgrace are the only things that survive, as celebrated verse and
 song**. In his Damon Pythias (A Roman legend) he extols the
 love of friends that knows no fear of death.
    Appa Rao read Viresalingam’s works and became an admirer
 of his earnest endeavours in the sphere of social reform. In order
 to rouse indolent minds, he wrote his social drama Kanyasulkam
 (the Bride’s price) which produced a powerful impr«»ssion on the
 receptive readers. The merits of this drama will be further
 discussed under “ Drama ” in the next section. Appa Rao had
 advocated the use of the spoken tongue for literary purposes, long
 before the modern Telugu movement was organised. His writings,
 particularly Kanyasulkam strengthened the movement, and the
success of the movement increased the popularity of his works.
 He had a remarkably good taste for song and music which is
evident in his lyrics — Xilagin Patalu (songs of the Blue hills).
The notes in his “ Diaries ” are proof of his liberal views on life
and letters.
    His poem Puttadi Bomma Purnamma is the crowning piece among
his early poems. It is the tragic story of a young girl, Puttadi
Bomma Pwrnamma (a statuette of Gold) who had been given in
marriage to an old man by her avaricious parents. Purnamma
embraces death to avoid the lifelong companionship of her husband.
The metre adopted by Appa Rao in his Mutyala Saramulu and
other songs was a novel feature in high-class literary composition.
It corresponds to misra tala in music (containing seven matras
in a foot 3 plus 4). It is not new to singers of Janapada g^as and
songs, nor to the Kannadigas who have dieir Bhamini Sheupadas.
Its adoption in Telugu verse is, however, a novelty introduced
by Appa Rao. In course of time, modem poets includmg
Rayaprolu Subba Rao adopted this metre.
   Rayaprolu Subba Rao (1892) was bom in a family of pandits.
His maternal unde, Awari Subrahmanya Sastri who translated
into Telugu, Kaxyadarsa by Dandi, tau|^t him Sanskrit as well
    12

   as Tclugu. His aunt (mother’s younger sister)'who had good
   literary taste and attainments was a source of inspiration in his
   early years. At her instance, he translated into Telugu verse,
   Sankara’s immortal song Bhaja Govindam. While yet he was a
   student of the upper classes in a high school, he composed in 1909
  Lalita as an adaptation of Goldsmith’s Hermit and it revealed that
   Subba Rao had in him the makings of an eminent poet. His
   Xrinakankanam was acclaimed in literary circles as the prelude
  to Navya kavita (the new poetry) in Tclugu literature. Then
  follo\ved several poems Ammati, a free translation of Tennyson’s
  Dora and Kashta Kamala^ Svapna Kumaramuy Jada Kuchchulu, Andhra-
  vali, Madhuri darsanam and Ramyalokamu. Of these, Andhravali
  renders homage to the Telugu country and its devoted sons and
  daughters. There is a marked difference between Appa Rao and
  Subba Rao in respect of their love for the motherland. While
  Subba Rao looks to the past for inspiration, Appa Rao looks
 ahead for action in the present for a great future. In fairness to
  Subl)a Rao, it must be recognised that no other Tclugu
  poet, past or present, has given such an elevating picture
  of the glory of the land in its manifold aspects. Andhm
 ravali is a collection of 33 short poems arranged under five heads;
 the second is prabodham in which is depicted a vision of India
 and her culture with special reference to Andhra, in Pratibha-
 chakram is depicted the service rendered to the progress of cultiure
 by eminent scholars, poets and philosophers, like Rabindranath
 Tagore, Sarojini Devi, Radhakrishnan, Ramalinga Reddi and
 Gurazada Appa Rao; in Sadhu Sodhana^ the poet pays tribute
  to the Buddha and the Mahatma. The object of Subba Rao is
 not merely to extol the past, but also to inspire the Telugus of
 the present and future generations to activity and emulation.
  Vanamala is a collection of about thirty short poems relating to
 feasts and festivals and the sports and pleasures of children; it
 contains also elegiac poems touching the demise of Gidugu
 Rariiamurti and Rabindranath Tagore.
     Ramya-kkam sums up his philosophy of poetry. “ There is no
 tapas other than bfmha (language) for the moderns ”, says Raya-
 prolu. His prayer is, May I be born again with sweet Telugu
 as my mother tongue.” He is a great lover and devotee oiPraknti
 (nature). She Js his family deity, and the cuckoo his xninstr^

the whole of Bharat, And it leads him on to universal love.

 irrespective of caste, creed or social distinctions. ** He is like
  the fragrant breeze that caresses even the untouchables **,
    The heroine in Kashta Kamala is a rustic girl, handsome like a
 child of Nature. And she grows up in an environment dear to
 the poet and in consonance with his ideals. Subba Rao’s early
 association with Rabindranath Tagore, Andhra Ratna Gopala
 Krishnayya and K. V. Lakshmana Rao shaped his outlook on life.
 The splendid inspiration which he derived from his Guru Deva is
 reflected in his literary achievement.
    Subba Rao’s Kanne patalu (maiden sohgs) published recently,
 contains occasional songs which he has been composing for years,
 to amuse and cnteitain children. His Rvpanavamtam is an alle¬
 gorical drama in which he portrays his ideal of love, as expounded
 by Anandavaidhana. Pure love, unsullied by lust or Kama
 (desire) is what is celebrated in his poems — particularly in
  Tnmkankanam the hero and heroine loved one another, but a
cruel fate parted them. Since they could not be united in wedlock,
 they vowed eternal friendship, as a token of which the hero adorned
 her wrist with a bracelet of grass bathed in tears. They then
accosted each other as Brother and Sister. I have rarely come
across a poem or a story with such beautiful sentiments.
    There is in Subba Rao’s poetry a happy reconciliation of the
classical style of expression with the model n outlook. His poetic
conventions have won the approbation of classicists as well as
modernists.
    The new poetry {navya kavita) that evolved in the second decade
of the twentieth century won a high place in literature by virtue
of its widening appeal. I happened to meet my friend, G. Hari-
sarvottama Rao at a co-operative conference held in 1920 at
Madras. He was then Editor of the Telugu Daily, Andhra Patrika,
He was in search of a name for this new poetry. We discussed
its main features. It was Harisarvottama Rao who then coined
the expression Bhava kavitvam and I readily approved of it. That
very evening he made use of it in Andhra Patrika. ITic name
gained gentral acceptance and the poets came to be known as
Bha&a Kavulu. The distinctive features of Bhava kavitvam (as
diflTerent from classical poetry) are worthy of note. While the
classical poets cared for rasa (sentiment), Bhava kavis cared for
Bhaoa (emotion). When some classicists protested against the
name Bhaaa kavitvam, on the ground that it would insinuate a lack
180                                 HISTORY OF TBLUOU LITERATURE

of Bhaoa in classical poetry, a modernist justified the use of the
name by saying that there was no insinuation *!n it, and it only
meant that the new poets cared more for bhava than for rasa,
Patibanda Madhava Sarma (1911) a modern poet described
Bhava kavitvam as possessing (certain recognisable qualities:
gamyogyam (fit to be sung), atmanayakam (subjective), vyangya
pradhanam (suggestive), ekabhavasrayam (depending on one central
emotion) and lagku rachana (short composition). This was only
a tentative definition. With a few exceptions, the Bhava kavis
have not generally the depth of scholarship which the classical
poets possessed. They do not observe the rules of poetics,
prescribed in Kavyalankara Sastras; nor do they hesitate to
transgress the rules of grammar, and the canons of poetics in
the matter of theme or the choice of heroes and heroines. The
Bhava kavis are interested in portraying contemporary life, and
even their personal joys and sorrows, and their success or
failure in matters of love or ambition. They would make a
rustic youth a hero and a rustic maid a heroine. They would
sing their joys and pleasures, and portray their sorrow and
dbtress with sympathy. They prefer themes relating to love
(romance), but while in the case of the classical {prabandha) poet.
Rati (consummation) is the Sthayibhava (the principal idea) of the
sentiment of Sambhoga sringara, the Bhava kavi is fond of Vipralambha
sringara, the feeling or sentiment of love in separation similar to
what he finds in Kalidasa*s Meghaduta. In describing the beauty
of women, the classical poet does not hesitate to describe even
parts covered on account of modesty but the Bhava kavi does not
refer to them. Rayaprolu’s Trma kankanam illustrates these
points; he expresses a beautiful sentiment when he pleads that
there is greater happiness in separation, and that light following
darkness shines better. Krishna Sastri echoes these sentiments
in his Krishna Paksham,
   Diverse are the ways in which love is treated by the Bhava kavisi
 Basavarazu Appa Rao adapts in his lyrics, the words of Tennyson,.
 “ It is much better to have loved and wept when it wa" lost, than
 to rejoice without having loved at all’*. Nayani Subba Rao
raises love to the level of pilgrimage to a holy shrine, in his S0vbluk*
 drmi Pranaya Taira and the lover is hailed as a devotee* Siva
 Sankara Sastri extols his Lady Love an^ glorifies the eult of her
 worship in his Hridayesvan, He says: “ I dream of thee as my
 MBW TRENDS : POETRY                                                  181
  <learest love and adore thee as my heart’s Deity; I love thee as
   the very deity of my life; thou art the goddess whom I worship and
   meditate upon, within myself”. In his Kinnerasani Patalu (a
  river-damsel), Visvanatha Satyanarayana refers to the brooks
   and rocks as evoking in him the feeling of love and separation.
   The song and dance of a love-lorn damsel is felt and visualised
   when the brook descends from the top of the hill with a rhythmic
  sound and meanders in dancing poses.
     The cult of Madhurabhakh prevailing in the country has also
  influenced some bhavakavis. Venkata Parvatisvaia kavulu were
  the votaries of this cult. The seeker after God (the Jivatma who
  longs to be one with the Paramatma) is like the love-sick woman in
  quest of her lover—her Lord. In Ekanta seva this type of bhakti is
  portrayed with great poetic skill by these twin-poets. This
  reminds me of a song of Tyagaraja, the greatest Telugu vaggeyakara.
  In his song Rama Sitarama, he says ” Just as a chaste wife is delighted
  to render service to her husband, I am delighted to celebrate your
 festivities; just as a creeper entwines itself round the kalpa tree,
  my mind is firmly attached to you and will never leave you”.
  Many other poets of this age portrayed this kind of madhura bhakti
 in their short poems—Basavarazu Appa Rao in his Virakinii
 Adhikaria Suryanarayana Rao in his J^alup’-aina-nemi? ” (what
 though he be dark in colour ?); Peddibhatla Puma Sarma in his
 Atma Samarpanam; Kamarazu Bapayya in his Vanamali; Krittivasa
.Tirthulu in his Gopika gitalu) Sankhavaram Raghavacharlu in his
 Radha pilupu (call); Ghavali Bangaramma in her Radha; Sthanapati
 Rukminamma in her Vanamali and Vattikonda Visalakshi in her
 Pranaya bhiksha.
     Nature appealed to classical poets as well as to the modern
 poets, but there is a difference in their approach. The description
 of nature made by the classical poets is realistic and objective,
 while that of the Bkava kavis is idealistic, subjective and emotional.
 Poetic pathos was no doubt expressed by classical poets. Peddana,
 for example, described the sunset and said that the oppressive
 reddenini; of the setting sun was due to his anger at the cruel
 departure of Pravara after rejecting the intense love of Varudhini;
 but such emotional expressions are rare in classical poetry.             '
 kavis are not generally satisfied with a realistic description; they
       in nature a response to their emotions, and a source of inspira-
   ion. As Rayiqnelu Subba Rao once said) Nature is worshipped
182                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

 by the Bhava kavis as the visible God, just as the sun was worshipped
 by the primitive people and by the devotees <SF Surya-cult. Sri-
 rangam Srinivasa Rao (Sri Sri) looks upon nature in his Prakriti
 Gita with immense delight and offers salutations to her as the
 visible deity of his soul. There ivere, in the past, descriptions of
 the seasons. Rituvarnamm was by convention, one of the eighteen
descriptions required for a Prabandha. They were indeed very
 eharming, but they were not related to the emotions of the poet.
Bhava kavis find in the seasons they describe a kind of inspiration,
 an awakening, or a response to their emotions. Venkata Parvatis-
 vara Kavulu in t\\G\r Sarat Kumari hailed Autumn as a young
 maiden endowed with miraculous powers of stopping rains and
dispelling darkness. Belliiri Srinivasamurti, in his Ritupari-
devanam pours forth his lamentation, as each of the six seasons
reminds him of the grief caused by disappointment or failure.
Penumarti Venkataratnam in his Varsha rituvu welcomes the cloud
and the rain which assuage the affliction of the river, caused by
separation from her lord, the Sea, in summer. Puranam Kumara
Raghava Sastri in his Sarat expresses his intense joy in eontem-
plating the moonlit night and its serenity as he sat all alone on
the sands of the Krishna river. The mighty rivers, the Godavari,
the Krishna and the Tungabhadra inspired the poets of this age
to sing in praise of them. To Chinta Dikshitulu, the Godavari
is the very mother that nourished the people of the region. Adivi
Bapirazu found delight in describing Varada Godavari (the Godavari
in floods); Kodali SubbaRao in his Tungabhadra sings of just pride
of the river that she excels in the beauty of the clouds, while
dark or raining—hovering over her. Gurram Joshua in his
Akhanda Gautami addresses the river as an ever living and ever
youthful deity, and says, referring to the king Vishnuvardhana
and his poet-laureate, Nannaya, “men may exist and depart,
but you are eternal “. He then narrates the story of the past.
   Anything great or small, can lend a theme to the modernists.
Venkata Parvatisvara Kavulu sang the affliction of a lily which
appeared to them as a young maiden that accused hvr beloved
moon when about to set. Srirangam Narayanababu says in his
Minuguru Mitu that the tiny glow-worms are taught by nature to
twinkle like stars on earth to dispel darkness. Potukuchi Subrah-
manya Sastri rejoices at the blossoming^ ketaki flower. Kodali
Subba Rao gets inspiration from “ Stones ”—the pebbles as well
   NEW TRENDS : POETRY                                                    183
       as the rocks, and the inscriptions on the rock pillars, for the history
       they can tell. The moon has always been the delight of the poets.
         We find these emotions in classical poetry also but they were
      rare and were often lost sight of in the lengthy poems. Moreover
      there is a vast difference b^t^vden the classical and modem poets
      in their mode of expression. Vyangya^ suggested or implied, in
      contrast to Vachya (expressed in words), and Dhvani (the implied
      sense) as more important than the expressed sense are no doubt
      regarded by the classicists as essential features of good literary
      composition; but while they make a ‘sparing use of them, the
     Bhavakavi uses them frequently, and particularly in describing
      Love to avoid expressions offensive to modesty or decency.
         The employment of the spoken dialect as in the poems of
     Giirazada Appa Rao, and in Nanduri’s Tenli patalu, the spirit
     of defiance expressed by Devulapalli Krishna Sastri and Stt Sri,
     the romantic songs of some sensual poets and the comparative
     poverty of expression and the decadence of thought in the case of
     the poets of the third decade, have all combined to provoke the
     classicists to condemn and ridicule the Bhavakavis and their Bhava-
    kavitvam. Some poets like Katuri Venkateswara Rao and
     P. Lakshmikantam did not like to be called Bh(wa kavis, though
    their poems, like Tolakari, were of the best poems of the Bhtwa
    kavis, Rayaprolu Subba Rao effected a sort of compromise by
    substituting the name of Navya kavita for Bhava kavita. There
    is no doubt some truth in what Akkirazu Umakantam, a good
   scholar and fastidious critic said: Some poets had confused thoughts
    and used words without any significance with die result that the
   readers were at a loss to understand them. But Umakantam was
. too much of a cynic when he said that he could find no merit
   whatsoever in any of them. In his introduction to Palnati Vira
   eharitra by Srinatha, he said that there had been no good poetry
   in Tclugu literature and he could not appreciate either Nannaya’s
   or Tikkana*s works or even Srinatha’s other works. He said that
 . Palnati Virachanira was the first poem with an original theme on
   a level w!th the great Mahabharatay since the heroes of Palnad were
   according to Umakantam, as valorous as Arjuna, Bhima and
   Kama, he wished to convey the impression that Srinatha was the
   Vyasa of Telugu literature. In the same introduction, he pointed
   out the incorrect use of expressions made by the modem writers.
   But in spite of th^ faults, it may be asserted that much of the
184                                 HISTORY OF TSLUOU LITERATURS

poetry of the Bhava kavisy and of others who arc ^own as Liberals
has won wide appreciation. It has been recognised as great
poetry, and dwells long in the memory of lovers of literature.

              (b) Story poems—mair&y oj entirely narrative

   Bhava kavis do not generally attempt lengthy story-poems, but
select an interesting incident or a hero from the Itihasas and express
their reactions to them. Sivasankara Sastri went further and
selected for his theme Lo^amudra of the Vcdic lore and composed
a short poem in which she is represented as having appealed to
her lord, Agastya, who was always engaged in iapas\

      “ How queer is this! though long I smile.
          And wait to have thy grace.
      Thou liftest not thy head a while
          And show thy winsome face! ”

   Madhavapeddi Butchi Sundara Rama Sastri composed a poem
Panchavati with a theme from the Ramayana. Panchavati was the
place on the bank of the Godavari where Rama spent a long
period of his banishment with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana.
The poet was enamoured of the story in his early years, when he
was daily listening to the recitation of the poem by his father.
And when he developed his poetic art he desired to compose this
poem to illustrate the noble qualities of Lakshmana, Sita and
Rama. Lakshmana’s purity of aim and his devotion to Rama
and Sita are portrayed in exquisite verse. The poet invents new
poetic conventions; he compares Urmila to the white Ketaki,
flower, because whiteness indicates purity, and Lakshmana to the
coiled cobra because, according to the Adhyatma Ramayaruiy he
was an incarnation of Adisesha. The author’s language is
melodious and dignified.
   Gottumukkala Ramakrishna Sastri composed a poem about
Kunti the mother of the Pandavas. He brings to j^ominence
the character of Kunti and interprets her joys and sorrows and
her reactions at the several stages of the development of the main
story of the Mahahharata. It is not a regular narration of events,
but a poetic description of the emotions tosa woman placed in the
situation of Kunti. The descriptions are very appealing*

    Satyanarayana Ghaudari’s Mayabhikshuvu is a fairly lengthy
poem of more than two hundred verses. It relates to the story of
 Bali the Asura King who was pressed down to the nether regions
 by Vamana, the dwarf incarnation of Vishnu. The justification
 for this punishment of Bay by Vamana was, according to the
PuranaSf the conquest of Svarga by Bali and his overweening
vanity, though it was conceded that Bali was of a charitable dis¬
position. The author of this poem holds that Bali was too virtuous
 to deserve this punishment. Bali’s reign is praised by him in
glowing terms. He says that if Vamana was reputed to be an
incarnation of Vishnu and known for his attacliment to Indra and
sympathy for his wife Indrani, Bali, the emperor, was renowned
for his austerities and charities, and the Puranas had unnecessarily
condemned Bali. The boldness with which this poet frankly
expresses his feelings is admirable. The language is simple and
sweet.
   The twin-poets, Pingali Lakshmikantam and Katuri Venka-
teswara Rao composed a fairly lengthy poem known as Saundarom
nandam which may be regarded as a small epic. Though the
theme is not quite original, it is developed with consummate skill
and charm. The poem was well received bv the classicists as
well as by the modernists. The language is melodious and chaste;
 the thoughts are inspiring and dignified. How Nanda was urged
by his cousin, the Buddha, to become a Bhikku, how Nanda’s wife,
Sundari, could not bear separation fiom her husband and begged
for permission to be with Nanda as a Bhikkuni and how the aesthetic
love of Nanda and Sundari was finally transformed into wider
love for humanity—^all this is admirably described by the poets.
 It was all due to the magic spell of the Buddha. Though the
theme relates to the age of the Buddha, their dcsciiptions of events
recall the modem message of the Mahatma, who too was a votary
of Truth and Non-violence.
   Gadiyaram Sesha Sastri’s Siva Bharatam and Visvanatha
Satyanarayana’s Ramayana Kalpavtihham aie also narrative poems
but the^^are of the type of the classical epics and Prabandhas, They
do, however, exhibit the spirit of the present age. The former
relates the heroic deeds of Sivaji which appeal to the patriotic
spirit of the modern age. The latter is an old epic retold with
modom ideas and sentiments. The main characters are portrayed
 186                                 HISTORY OF ITILUOU UTBRATURE

   in such vivid colours that they inspire the readers and tiansport
   them to a higher plane of life and achievement.
      Pemmarazu Lakshmipati (1899—1943) was a poet of note.
   Of his lyrics Vasantam, Gnshmam and Tolakan are praiseworthy.
   They were composed in a fluent ^an4 melodious style. His short
   poems Bali (sacrifice) and Pali (an old maid-servant) relate to the
   poor unfortunate characters and move the hearts of even the
   “wicked rich”.
      Addepalli Naga Gopala Rao is a good scholar and a talented
   poet. His Kadamhari is an adaptation in Telugu verse of Bana*s
  original in Sanskrit. It has won the appreciation of the master
   poets and critics of this age.
     Srinivasa Sodarulu are good scholars of Sanskiit and Telugu
  and poets of eminence. Their Saban and Ortt^allukota are based
  on themes respectively from epics and historical narratives, and
  they are emotional, and contain picturesque desciiptions. The
  section, Bharata nan hndayam in Orugallukota relates to the heroism
  and sagacity of Rudiama Devi and is very inspiring. Saban
  contains melodious and affectionate expressions consistent with
  the nature of Sabari and Rama.
     Pratikaramu by Velamuri Venkata Subrahmanya Kavi is a good
 poem with an old theme from the Puranas. It is presented on
 new lines with modern proverbial expressions.
     Saranartki by Ballamudi Sita Ramamurti is an original poem
 relating to an incident during the political unrest in the Punjab.
 It is full of pathos.
    Mudigonda Jvalapatilinga Sasti i’s poem Rajaraja (Duryodhana)
 is no doubt based on the story of the Mahabharata but the author’s
interpretation is new; he justifies the conduct of Duiyodhana as
 a monarch. The style is elegant.
    Undela Malakonda Reddi (1932) is a precocious and talented
poet. Among his several poems, Vtvekananda (1952) and Krantu
chekralu (1959) display his poetical talent. The latter is a collection
of 26 brilliant short poems relating to varied topics. Every little
thing su^ests to him a poetic thought. It is remarkablB that he
composed a poem, Netaji^ in 1946 when he was only 14 years old.
    Vakkalanka Lakshmipati Rao’s Parijatasaurabhyamu is based on
the well-known episode in the Bhagasata and Nandi Timmana’s
Parijatapaharanam, but Lakshmipati’s poem is so ardstically
developed that the resentment of Krishnadevaraya vanished and
 NEW TRENDS ! POETRY                                           187
Tinimalamba’s offence came to be recognised by the king as a
figment of his own imagination. The poem is in simple language
with melodious expressions and charming ideas.

               (c) Psalms and H^mnsi Padas and Geyas

   By Psalms and Hymns is meant the metrical versions in Telugu
of the sacred songs or hymns, not only from the book of Psalms
of the Old Testament, but also»iother sacred songs of the Christian
faith. They were composed by the Telugu poets who embraced
Christianity. The Book of Psalms, known as Bodhana Kirtanala
Pustakam^ was published by the Madras Auxiliary Bible society
in 1845 and a smaller book known as Kirtanala Pustokam was
published in 1961. Hymns, other than Psalms, had been published
earlier. From a catalogue of the Telugu Books in the library at
the British Museum, we learn (vide p. 74) that Telugu Hymns in
English Metres, and Kirtanalu (edition by J. S. Wardlaw)—third
edition, revised throughout and enlarged—was published by the
South India Christian School Book Society at the Scottish Press,
Madras in 1857. In the same catalogue, under Downie (Annie H)
vide p. 59, mention is made of “ Telugu Christian Lyrics, selected
and reduced to music from the native airs, together with a number
of translations of English hymns, with their English tunes, for the
use of Telugu congregations—American Baptist Telugu Mission,
Madras, 1896”. The names of the authors are not noted but
one may be sure that the songs were composed by Telugu poets
of the type of Purushottam Chaudari, Telugu Christian poet,
who composed melodious lyrical songs during the last decades
of the 19th century. During the twentieth century, Telugu
Hymns, edited by D. Downie (third edition) was published by the
American Baptist Telugu Mission, Madras in 1910.
   The Brahmos also got some songs composed for the use of their
congregations. The Prarthana Samajam’s Brahma Gitamulu was
published in 1889 by the Secretaiy, South Indian Brahmo Samaj.
Even nan-Brahmos like Vaddadi Subbarayadu of Rajahmundry
were encouraged by Viresalingam Pantulu, a staunch Brahmo,
to compose some songs to be sung at congregations of the Brahmo
Samajams in the Telugu country.
  Padas and Gtyas: Long before the tv^^entieth century, Padams
or kirtanas were composed by Gopanna (Ramadas) of Bhadra-
188                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITBRATURB

chalam, Kshetrayya, Tyagaraja and a few other Vagg^akaras
(singers of their own songs). The first and third were devotees
of Rama and there was little scope for Madhura Bhakti (devotion
to the lord as Lover); but Kshetrayya’s Muvva Gopala Padamulu
arc of the type of Jayadeva’s Gita Govinda (Asktapadis) and are
therefore, full of such sentiment. Jayadeva’s Asktapadis were
translated into Telugu as songs by Raja M. V. Appa Rao of Vuyyur
during the second and third decades of this century. Many
poems of the modem poets were composed in mtUra metres and
they can be sung as songs. Regular songs of the type of Tyaga-
raja’s songs have been also composed by modern Vaggeyakaras
like G. Simhachalam. Popular songs are composed for the
screen, year after year, for the Telugu pictures by Samudrala
Raghavachari and his son, Devulapalli Krishna Sastri, Kosaraju
Raghavayya Chaudari, Sri Sri, Arudra and several others; and
they have been recorded by the gramophone companies. Some
of them like 01 Meghamala\ by Krishna Sastri are frequently
recited. Some nationalistic or patriotic songs like Ma^Temgu
teUliki malle pu danda and Tnlinga desam manadenojff Telungulante
manamenoy by Paidipati Subbarama Sastri (1918) are very
popular and are on the lips of many.
   Subbarama Sastri is coming to prominence with his scholarship
and poetic talent. His Nniya Bharati contains geyas relating to
Dasavataras and Vaggeyakaras.
   Balantrapu Rajanikanta Rao (1920) is a scholar and poet
whose Satapatra Sundari is a collection of hundred short poems
and g^as in Telugu. His Vaggeyakaras gives a detailed account
of the composer-musicians in Telugu. Both these books won the
state awards through the agency of the Telugu Bhasha Samiti,
Madras.
   Akkirazu Venkatesvara Sarma’s Sringara Tarangini is a short
poem of 105 verses, each of which illustrates a particular type of
the moods of the Nayika-Nayakas.

                             (d) Elegies

   There were stray verses like Srinatha’s Kasika Visvesu kalise
 Vira Reddi and Peddana’s Mantuharitrem^andukontt vela which
were elegiac, but regular elegies came tf^ be composed as the
result of contact with English literature, in the last decades of the
  NEW TRENDS : POETRY                                              189
   twentieth century: translations of English elegies as well as
  original elegies were composed by Telugu poets. Vavilala
  Vasudeva Sastri composed two elegies, Pttraradhanamu and Rvkmini
  Smaranamu the former in memory of his father and the latter on
  the death of his wife. Vaddadi Subbarayadu composed two
  elegiac poems, Sati Smiiti and Suta Smriti on the death of his wife
  and son respectively. B. Bapayya Sastri’s Putra Sokamu (1902),
  Adinarayana Murti’s Preyasi Smriti (1904), D. Jagannatha Rao*s
  Mitra Smriti (1910) are some of the early elegies of this century.
  Later on, Duwuri Rami Reddi, Visviyiatha Satyanarayana and
  Madhavapeddi Butchi Sundara Rama Sastri composed pathetic
  elegiac poems, when each of them lost his wife. Rami Reddi,
' naturally an emotional poet, wailed without restraint. Satya¬
  narayana had philosophic fortitude and Sundara Rama Sastri
  passed through an inward struggle to attain peace. Their elegiac
  poems are most appealing to the readers. Basavarazu Appa
  Rao’s Tamuna Santvanam on the death of Andhraratna Gopala
  Krishnayya is, though short, very moving. Peddibhatla Rama-
  chandra Rao’s Ravindra Miryanam^ Bharatula Markandeya Sarma’s
  Ravi Babuy and the songs and poems relating to the tragic end of
  Mahatma Gandhi are not regulai elegies but are elegiac in
  character. Addepalli Naga Gopala Rao’s Asrutarpanam touching
  the demise of poet Lakshmipati is short and appealing.

          (e) Descriptive poems relating to scenery {landscape),
                old Monuments and ruins, pictures, etc.

     Some short poems like Godavarimata, Gurram Joshua’s Akhanda
  Gautami etc., were mentioned under lyrics. Gurazada Appa
  Rao’s Mlagiri Patalu are descriptive poems relating to the scenery
   round about Ooty (Udakamandalam). Desirazu Krishna Sarma’s
  Sandra Ragint is an address to the ** Lady Dawn ” with descarip*
  tions of nature, and tender emotions expressed in reflective mood*
  Komanduri Krishnamacharyulu in his Pusbpandhayanm addresses
  the bes^ and describes the flowering trees of the garden. Adivi
   Radha Vasanta in her song VascaUa presents a short and sweet
  description of the season of spring. Rallapalli Ananta Krishna
  $anna’8 song Pemgonda Konda is a lyrical descriptioD of the hill
• at Penugonda with recollections of past hutorical glories; Ganti
  Jogi Somayaji’s Rmachandrmi Ham^yatra^ composed like Byron’s
 190                                HISTORY OF TBLUOU LITERATURB

Ghilde Harold contains desciiptions of the old monuments, in
ruins, at Hampi and exhibits a harmonious blend*of the ideas and
sentiments expressed by Western and Indian poets, Kodali
Subba Rao composed a poem on the same subject and it is regarded
as a charming poem of great meri|.
  Vidvan Visvam’s Pemetipata reflects the physical features and
the life of the people in Rayalasima. It is no doubt a story poem
with a very pathetic theme but is composed as a lyric. It deals
with the hardships of a poor rustic husband and wife, their immortal
love, their life of misery and their tragic end.
  Setti Lakshmi Naid'>imham composed poems relating to Ravi
Varma’s pictures. They \\'eie like a commentary on them.
What Ravi Varma had poitraved in colours was translated into
words by this poet.

                        (f) Parodies and Satires

   A parody is a humorous imitation of a serious piece of literature.
The war imagined to have been waged between the rats and the
frogs is a parody of Homer’s Iliad. Yallapantula Jagannatham
wrote his poem as Gadela Gandadu and Kappala Mindadu (The barn
hero, rat, and the frog hero) in imitation-of the English paiod>.
It was a splendid success because he made a keen observation of
the nature of the rats and frogs and the several varieties cf both
the species, and developed a plot in imitation of the war of the
Trojan and Greek heroes. There are, stray verses of the nature
of parodies composed by a few modern poets. For example,
Machirazu Devi Prasad composed a verse as a parody of Vcdula
Satyanarayana Sastri’s verse referring to the melodious notes of
Krishna’s flute. Satyanaiayana Sastri said:—

       “The sweetness of the divine nectar
       The mildness of the sweet moonlight

       And the fragrance of the mild breeze
       Are OI Gopala! in the melody of your flute ”

  Devi Prasad said referring to a sauce made by Buchchamma
a woman cook:
 MXW TRENDS .* POETRY                                           191
     “The sweetness of the divine nectar ,
     The mildness of the sweet moonlight
     And the fragrance of the mild breeze
     Are O! Buchchamma! in your raw tamarind sauce “

  Jalasutram Rukmininatha Sastri is generally known as Parody
Sastri because he composed many verses in imitation of the bathetic
verses that appear in the poetry of Visvanatha Satyanarayana.
Rukmininatha Sastri sometimes very cleverly culls together parts
of different verses of Satyanarayana’s composition and fits them
into a verse, which besides satisfying the metrical rules makes
some sense. He also composed some other verses imitating the
verses of his other contemporaries.

                 (g) Nationalistic and Patriotic Poetry

   Poems that had been composed in praise of our Bharat and of
our Telugu land prior to the Congress movement have been
already noticed. I shall here mention those that were the out¬
come of the political and nationalistic movement. Balijepalli
Lakshmilrantam,      Garimella    Satyanarayana,     Madhavapeddi
Buchchi Sundara Rama Sastry and some others poured forth
their love of the motherland in short poems and songs which
appealed to the cultured as well as the unsophisticated. Balijepalli
Lakshmikantarn’s Soarajyaratham and Svarajyasamasya were very
inspiring. He described in them the nature of the political
movement-!—its origin and development, the service rendered by
Bal Gangadhar Tilak, the entrance of Mahatma Gandhi into the
political arena, his call to the people and their awakening to a
sense of their duty to the country. Garimella Satyanarayana’s
song commencing with Ma^k-oddi tella dora tanamu ... spread like
wild-fire throughout the Telugu country and was recited by
hundreds of people during 1921—1923 and by non-Andhra
political prisoners who were the poet’s comrades in jail. It
means “ We don’t want this white government            white stands
here for the British. He composed some more songs of a similar
nature. He was imprisoned for sedition and his songs were
banned, and those that sang them were likewise imprisoned. He
wras a graduate and gave up his studies while he was imdergoing
training at Rajahmundry. He could get no job and was reduced
192                                   HISTORY OF TRLUOU LTISRATURS

to abject poverty. Hp composed, even during his days of starva¬
tion prior to death, verses in matra metre as a frce»rcndcring of
Bhagavat Gita.
   Madhavapeddi Buchchi Sundararama Sastri was a gifted
composer of nationalistic songs, ■^ho could also sing them most
melodiously. He attracted large crowds and, when he began
to sing, there used to be perfect silence in the gathering. His
speeches as well as verses were usually flavoured with a touch of
humour. He belonged to an orthodox family but was very
forward in leading the movement against “ untouchability.”'
Just a line to illustrate his humour:

      Antaranivarevaro karu, ma
           venta ranivare.

It means ** they are the untouchables who do not follow us.*'
   There were during 1930—47 hundreds of such songs relating
to the fight for independence, and the movement against un-
touchability and the uplift of the down-trodden Harijans. We
do not know the names of the authors, nor were the authors eager
to have their authorship publicised. Their songs have become
public property. During those days, bands of patriots were
awake at early dawn, and marched along the streets, singing the
“songs of awakening.” They were melodious as they were
sung in the appropriate raga of Bhupala. Just a stanza to illustrate
such a song:—

      Mebtkonumil Bharataputrudal
      Melukonumil Sujana mitrudal
      Melukonumil Sat-charitrudal
      Melukonavayyal Vatsal Melukol

  Meluko or Melukomimi means “ wake up thou (from sleep)” and
other words are Sanskrit equivalents which Telugus generally
use and understand. Hundreds of songs were composed in praise
of Mahatma Gandhi. Basavarazu Appa Rao said in a song
**What though our Gandhi wears a loin cloth? What though
he is bom a Vaisya? ”
  Somarazu Ramanuja Rao, Sripada Krishnamurty Sastrh
Marepallt Ramachandra Sastri, Adivi Bapirazu, Sivasankara
 MEW trends: poetry                                             193
  Sastri, Abburi Ramakrxshna Rao, Vedula Satyanarayana Sastri
  and several other poets composed poems or verses to promote
  nationalism. Women also encouraged the movement in several
  ways, and of them Maganti Annapurna, Unnava Lakshmi-
  bayamma were prominent. Piifttavarti Kanakamma composed
  a fine poem in praise of Kasturba.
    Some poets of this period thought of writing about the great
  heroes of the past who had fought for political freedom. Of them
 Durbhaka Rajasekhara Satavadhani (1888—1957) who wrote
 Rmapratapasimha Charitra as a lengthy poem in the classical {pra~
 bandha) style was the foremost. After serving as a clerk in the
 District Munsiff’s court at Proddatur (Rayalasima) he responded
 to the call of Mahatma Gandhi, resigned his job in 1921, and
 worked in the nationalist movement. Although he had already
 made a name as a poet and satavadhani by composing some poems
like Viramati Charitram (1916) it was only after he resigned his job
 that he came to prominence as an author of great merit. He was
 honoured at several places and was the recipient of many titles.
 Ghellapilla (the first Telugu poet-laureate) paid him a handsome
and well-deserved compliment: “This Ranapratapasimha Charitra
deserves to be widely read like the Epic Ramayana,.. Among the
modem poets, he must be reckoned as the first in merit and he
is not an ordinary poet ”. This poem describes the struggle of the
Rajputs to be independent of the Moghul suzerainty, the surrender
of some of them, the futile attempts of the Moghuls to win over
Rana Pratap, the fall of Chittor, the life of privation led by
Pratap, his family and followers and Pratap’s noble traits, hia
magnanimity and fortitude. The descriptions arrest the attention
of the readers, inspire the young men to fight for freedom against
odds, even as Pratap had done.
   Gadiyaram Venlmtasesha Sastri who had been ^n associate of
Rajasekhara Kavi in his avadhanams (1912) composed his Siva
Bharatam (life of Sivaji) with the same patriotic outlook, and it
was appreciated by great poets and scholars like Veturi Prabhakara
Sastri ancUR. Ananta Krishna Sarma.

 m                                 mSTORY OR TELUOU LITERATURE

            (h) Poems of Ideologks—Socialistic^ Commmistic,
                    Realistic and Sur-realistic^ etc*

    Some young poets who felt fed up with conventional poetry
 sought new ideologies for their poetic inspiration. They could
 find in the post-war literary tendencies in Europe (1920—39)
 what they wanted. Imagism, Impressionism, Futurism, Dadaism,
 Expressionism, Cubism, Symbolism, Realism, and Sur-realism
 and such other -isms attracted them. Some of them evinced
interest in the progress made in Russia by the Soviet Government,
 and in the great power developed by the Communists. The
young poets that had been inspiied by these developments ^vrote
their poems and sang their songs defying all opposition in the
 countrv. Thev are modestly called Ahhyndrya (Progrcssi^ e) writers.
    In 1932 a Tclugu Journal known       Jvala (flame) with hluddu
Krishna as editor, came into existence. The name is symbolic.
The editorial announcement was bold and frank. It said: “ We
have become effeminate in life, thought, expression and deeds;
we are like frogs in the well and like the owls that close their eyes
against the sun light. Change is inevitable, in our dhnrma^ our
society, our concepts, our language. We encourage revolt in all
spheres of activity. We shall publish, in this journal, wiilings
that contain fresh and inspiring thoughts... ”
   Srirangam Srinivasa Rao (Sri Sri) was the leader of this move¬
ment and has been hailed as a Mahakavi. He was in the beginning
one of the Bhavakavis but in course of time parted company svith
them. He declared:

     ** We have no walls
     Unrest is our life
     Agitation is our breath
     Rebellion, our philosophy.”

   Sri Sri and his followers have been rebels in language, metre,
form and ideas; they would rebel against the tirntf^iionoured
conventions or any authority which became effete or hampered
freedom of thought and expression. Sri Sri and others of this
school do not hesitate to mix up English and Telugu expressions
in manipraaala style. Just a few stanzasillustrate Sri Sri*s
poetry;—

 Itivala means “ recently ” and ma incanf “ our **.
     Maha Prasthanam is one of the best poems of Sri Sri. Gudipati
 Venkatachlam, a scholar, fice-tliinkcr and author, wrote a fine
 introduction to this poem in which he sa>b that Sri Sri cndcavouis
 to destroy the old oidcr of life with all its out-of-date conventions,
 customs and traditions. An ardent and even hectic desire to
 build a new world is the foundation of his poetry.
    Sri Sri has had some followers and many admirers. Arudra,
 his nephew and follower, is equally brilliant and has composed
some poems of that type. Pattabhi has gone a step further in
 this matter and written Fickl ratfala dazan. Sri Sri wrote an
introduction to this book, in which he sajs, “ TJie poet is the
harbinger of independence in all spheres and he generously bestows
freedom. The dictates of the metrical rules arc out of date. It
is only the outburst of the poet’s emotions that should determine
the metrical form. The modem poet abhors imitation. New
forces should have a new garb
    Sri Sri’s poems contain inspiring ideas and though they are
expressed in an apparently chaotic way, there is “ some method
in that madness ”. Disgusted with the prevailing order of things
in this world, he cries:—

       * Maro prapancham^ maro prapamham
       Padandi Podam, vinabadaleda?
       Maro prapanchapu Jalapatam?

       And “ Aniuaga ” be the sky
       We shall decry the world
       and rule over the Future ”

    Veteran scholais like Tapi Dharma Rao also were enamoured
 of Sri Sri’s new verses. Visvanatha Satyanarayana, who presided
 over an annual conference of the Navy a Sahttya Panshad in 1940,
 embraced Sii Sri with tears of joy in his eyes and blessed him.
 Dharma Rao himself composed a short poem in which he described
 the woes of the poor and starving people of the country. Prayaga
 Kodanda Rama Sastri, a scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu composed
 some verses in which he wondeied how men reduced to abject
 poverty and obliged to “ eat pebbles and drink the water of the
 rivers” could move alongside of the sons of the rich. Kundurti
 Anjancyulu said: “I cannot live as a slave to the innumerable
 castes and creeds; I would rather be born again as a teacher to
educate the society      Anisetti Subba Rao desires to crudh, under
the wheels of the progressive car, the rulers who play with the
heads of the labourers, cut off and used as foot>balls. Narla
Chiranjivi says “ The chains which have kept us in boihla^^ for
many ages must be broken ”.
   The Progressive writers encourage progressive trends in all
spheres of human life and activity—social welfare, politicalfreedom^
the cffacemcnt of caste and creed, and banning of reli^ous 60iiflicts»
^otlapalli Rama Rao praises the proletariat as the very essence
  HEW trends: poetry                                             J97
 of the world and wails that it is suppressed by the arrogant rulers,
 the blood-sucking rich—the landlords and the factory owners.
 Kaloji Narayana Rao is kind and gentle, but ferocious in attacking
 tyranny and cruelty. He contrasts the places of happiness and
 misery with poetic fervour in a'verse which means:—

      Heaps of food are there at distant places
      While pangs of hunger arc here heard;
      Stores of wealth arc there in mansions high
      While large families are here in want;
      Opportunities are there beyond our reach
      While needs are here without amends.

     Devulapalli Ramanuja Rao says that the songs of no other
   poet attracted the people of Telangana so much as those of Kaloji.
   Kuruganti Sitarama Bhattacharya says that Kaloji is the second
  Garimella. Dasarathi Krishnamacharya, a young and brilliant
  poet of the present generation, even excelled Sri Sri in poetic
  talent and the outpouring of progressive ideas. He says that time
  is waiting to attack them from an ambush and devour the bandits,
  who robbed the poor of what they earned with the sweat of their
  labour, and of what they were eating for baic sustenance.
     With a few exceptions, the Progressive poets generally have no
  regard for correctness of expression or consistency of thought;
 some of them are eager to use lengthy Sanskrit compounds—
  correct or incorrect, which do not appeal to the masses for whom
 they are apparently writing.
     Bellamkonda Ramadas (1923) has passed through several
 ideological phases. One of his earliest compositions, Smasanam a
 doggerel addressed to Siva, shows some promise of poetical talent.
 In course of time he became a Progressive poet of an aggressive
type. He hates the present social order which according to hhn,
** has blind-folded our eyes and has dug under our very feet a well
of swords and he vows to destroy it.” He inspired his friends like
Anisetti «&ubba Rao, to contribute to a series of writhes
published under the caption of J^ayagara which implies that their
writings have the force of the Niagara Falls.
    The frightful and tragic movement of the Razakars in Telengana
produced many poets of the Abhyudeya or the Progressive type.
JDaaaradu’s Affi^arvaiam (volcano) erupted with thimdearing
 19a                                HISTORY OF TBLUOtl LITESATOKH

 ^sounds of fury when the Razakars massacred the innoceilf people
 and plundered their property. To his Agnidftara^ Dcvulapallf
 Ramanuja Rao wrote a scholarly introduction in which he says-
 Dasarathi is the poet who could give prominence to the problems
 of the down-trodden poor.           ^
    Avantsa Somasundar (1924) commenced with attacking the
 t>ranny of the bourgeois and declared his desire to build a world
 of Kuchelas on the ruins of the Kuberai. He held for a time his
  Vajrayudham to vanquish Nazism in the land of the Nizam. He
 condemns even God and says, “He is a wretched god of stone
 with a stony heart and bereft of the sense of hearing, because the
 rich have purchased him and poured into his ears molten lead ”.
    There arc some poets whose poems arc pastoral or emotional.
 They may be reckoned as Bhavakavis but they exhibit the spirit of
 the progressive writers, Gaiigula Sayi Reddi’s Raitubidda (the
cultivator’s child) seeks to rouse the cultivators of the rural areas
by telling them that the crops they raise feed the blood-sucking
rich. Nagabhairava Sivarama Krishna appears in his Vidyullala
 (The lightning streak) to be partly a Bhavakaoi and partly a poet
of the Abhytidaya school.
   Srirangam Narayana Babu (190G) is both a Bhavakavi and a
progressive writer. Kapalamohsham, Ktlikilo dipam (a light in the
window sill), Uravatala (outside the village) Gaddiparaka (a grass
blade) are some of his short poems. He is an adept in describing
gruesome scenes of social life.
   Bhagavatula Sankara Sastri (1925) popularly known as Arudra,
his pen-name, is a nephew of Sri Sri, who extols the former’s poetical
talent by saying “ Now that Arudra has come into the field of
progressive writing, it does not matter if I retire from it   Arudra
has no doubt remarkable poetic talent but he is not half so-
brilliant as Sri Sri, in either ideas or expression.
   There are many more poets of some merit that have to be
mentioned under Progressive writers, but I have no space for them'
here. I should like to close this section by presenting extracts-
from the opinions of great scholars on this subject.
   Herman Quid, International Secretary of P.E.N. Free Press-
says (19-11-1945) “I do not believe in creative writers using
their gifts for propaganda       Dr. S. Radhakrishnan says, “Many
of our modem works take shape in our i^ts, not in our souls.
They have teehnibal skill, intellectual power, but do not have that
 NEW trends: poetry                                               199
  inspiration, that rare adequacy of mind which is essential for
  ^reat art.*’
      M. Ramanujarao Naidu says, ** there is emotion but no poetic
  art to express it      Sivasanka»^ Swami expresses the same view
   and adds that the similes are \tilgar. I repeat what I remarked
  fifteen years ago, that “ much of this ultra-modern poetry cannot
  live long. What is written for the nonce is forgotten soon after
  the occasion is past
     The little poetic merit which we may find in poems like Desirazu
  Krisima Sarma’s Dayyala Pendli (the tmarriage of the devils),
 Jammalamadaka Suryaprakasa Rao's poem relating to gruesome
  scenes of massacre and bloodshed is obscured by the bewildering
  themes they have selected.
     There arc, ho^vever, some poets who, as occasion arose, became
  ultra-modern, but by virtue of their scholarship, culture and
  taste, have continued to be the authors of poems which have a
 lasting value, viz., Puripanda Appalaswami (1901), Mallavarapu
 Visvesvara Rao (1906),Prajan«aAai»i Sankarambadi Sundarachari
 (1914), Indrakanti Hanumat Sastri (1911), Patibanda Madhava
 Sarma (1911), Puttaparti Narayanachaiya (1915), Raghavachari
 Sampatkumar (Sampat, pen-name) (1917).
     Puripanda AppaUswami’s poems (romantic) were translated
 into English and published in Triveni. Inspit cd by Devulapalli
 Krisima Sastri, he wrote Bhavakavitvam; and inspired by Sri Sri,
 he became an Abhyudaya and ultra-modem poet. He has rendered
 greater service to Telugu literature by translating some of llxe best
 works in modern Oriya literature.
    Mallavarapu Visvesvara Rao is a product of Visvabharati and
 a poet of romanticism. In the heydey of the progressive move¬
 ment, he wrote many poems, some of which were publislicd in
 Pratibha with the pen-name of PIri Hri. His Madhukila^ a collection
 of romantic poems, is as the name indicates, sweet in thought.
 Another is Kdyana Kinkini. By nature he is tender hearted and
very emotional. But when he gives way to impulse, he becomes
a poet cf the Progressive type.
    Prasanna kavi Sankarambadi Sundarachari: His song, Ma
 Telugu talliki maUepudanda is very popular and is frequently
recited at public literary meetings as a prayer song. Sundarachari
is also the author of several short poems like Ekalaxya^ Ptda kavi
(a poor poet), Sundara Bharatam and Sundara Ramayanam for
children. He has, I think, a bright future.

    Indrakanti Hanumat Sastri is a good scholar of Sanskrit and
 Telugu. He drew inspiration from Krishna SaStri and Sri Sri
 He cares for elegant language and good expression as could be
 seen from his verses and songs which are partly romantic and
 partly of the progressive type. '
    Nanduri Venkata Ramakrishnamacharyulu is a scholar and
literary critic of note. He has published a book of poems Tara
  Toranam which has been welcomed as an important contribution
 to recent literature. Sirna Mekhala is the finest of bis poems.
    Patibanda Madhava Sarma is a modest, occasional poet, though
he has admirable scholarship and a talent for writing. His Vtraha
 Gopi is a good specimen of his romantic poetry, and his “ Battle
of Tallikota ” illustrates his ability to compose a heroic poem.
 His Ckaruni is a short and charming poem.
    Sampat (Raghavachari Sampat kumar) is a good scholai of
Telugu, Sanskiit and English and has exhibited in his writings
the scholarship of the pandits, the emotions of the BhavaJ ai ts, and
the excitement of the progressive writers. We find in his writings
a blending of somewhat divergent features peculiar to the works
of Visvanatha Satyanarayana, Dcviilapalli Krishna Sastri and
Sri Sri. Syamanta panckakani) Meghasandemmy and Anantam are his
more important poems.
   The Visalandhra Publishers of Vijayawada, who are mainly
interested in modern Progressive writing, have also sought out
earlier writers who had given expression to egalitarian views.
They regard Kandukuri Viresalingam, Desoddharaka Nagesvara
Rao, Gurazada Appa Rao, Gidugu Ramamurti and Komarrazu
Lakshmana Rao as the mahapurushas (great men) of this modem
age. They have published, with devotion, the works of Appa
Rao and Ramamurti.
   The following lines of Appa Rao have inspired the Progressive
writers as well as others:—

      “ Our Land—a huge and mighty tree
      It should abound in flowers of Love
      ** Couched and perched among the leaves
      The Cuckoo of the Muse should warble sweet,
      With nourishing melodies our country should sprout
      Affections strong and sweet **.

                  (i) Spiritual and PhSoscpMcal Poms

     This modern age docs not sewn to be propitious for producing
  poetry of a spiritual and philosophical nature. There are, no
 doubt, a few poets among the tlassicists and modernists who have
  composed lengthy poems of the Prabandha type and short poems
  of the modem type with themes having spiritual and philosophical
 significance, but they arc comparatively rare. Even the spiritual
 or Vedantic songs that may be classed under Janapada geyas are
 only of the previous century and the nearly years of this century
 and they seem to have become out of date now.
    There are, however, essays and books in prose and they will be
 noticed in the next section.
    Bhagavadgtta is still the most popular sacred book in our Telugu
 country, as in the other parts of India, and there are Telugu poets
 who translated it into Telugu verse. Vemuganti Dattoji’s render¬
 ing in Telugu verse, edited by M. Buchchayya, was published at
 Madras in 1891 and 1897. Indrakanti Venkata Sastri rendeied
 Bhagtoiadgita in dvipada verse undei the heading of Han Sukti-
tarangini. In the early years of this century, Adipudi Somanatha
 Rao published his translation in easy Telugu verse. There have
 been several other translations but the best I have seen is the
 translation by Sonthi Sripati Sastri. It was published on the
 auspicious occasion of the inauguration of the Andhra State in
 1953. It was well received by the scholars of the day, some of
 whose opinions were published in the book. I repeat what I
stated there. “ It is a close and faithful translation of the original
and at the same time it reads as an original poem and not as a
translation. The rendering is so simple that an ordinary Telugu
reader can understand it well enough
    Rama and Krishna are the two incarnations of Vishnu that
appeal to the devotees among the Smartas and Vmshmmsy and
of them Rama appeals to a larger number of people in the Telugu
country than Krishna. There are about fifty Telugu versions
of the ^Kamayana and many songs relating to the story of Rama.
After Gofnnatha Ramayanam of die previous century, there have
appeared in this century Andhra Valmiki Ramayanami as a literal
metrical translation by Vavilikolanu Subba Rao. Visvanatha
Satyanarayana has {HiUished his monumental work Ramayma
dta^mirikskam with the xeal        a devotee and the visum of a seer.
202                                HISTORY or TSLOQV LtlEXATtnUS

 With the same zeal, Atmakuri Govindachaiya has published his
 Govtnda Ramaymam and his verses are in simple and easy flowing
 language. It is well received by scholars.
    Of the short poems, Utpala Satyanarayanacharya’s Saranagati
 deserves mention. It relates to Vibhishana’s complete surrender
 to Rama with full devotion and implicit faith. The author, being
 a Vaishnava^ exhibits the well known Vaishnava Prapatti. This
 poem has the features of a lyric also, when he makes it subjective
poetrv. Divakarla Venkatavadhani has written a scholarly
introduction to this poem.«
   Janamanchi Seshadri Sarma, a liberal classicist of this age,
transl xted Brahmanda Puranam and Kahvilasam besides many other
poems. Kalivila mm refei s to the present state of waxing materialism
and the decline of spiritual values, and directly and indirectly
ad/ises the voung generation to follow the right path. The
language used is the classical [kavya) dialect, but it is simple and
can be easily understood by the ordinary reader.
   Kalpalata by Guruzada Raghava Sarma is a collection of nine
short poems rich in emotion and poetical skill, viz., Vinati (Suppli¬
cation), Sandananam (Intelview), Vatsalyam (affection), Potana^
matyudu (Potana, author of the Bhagavatd)^ Gopikahridayamu (the
heart of the Gopika), Vedikolu (request), Sraddhanjali (levcicntial
salutation), Grahastavam (Praise and Prayer to the nine planets).
In Vinati he pays his humble respects to his elders, gurus and gods:
Sandarsanamu is his original conception of Siva visiting the house
of Yasoda in the garb of a mendicant to have a look at the child
Krishna. Vatsalyam is an interesting stoiy of an unsophisticated
young boy who, deputed by his parents, takes a cup of milk to
offer it to Devi Bhavani’s idol in a temple on the outskirts of a
village and would not leave the place until and unless the deity
drank it. Potanamatyuda is an admirable poem in praise of Potana's
poetic art exhibited in his Bhagavata. The author of this poem
very dexterously combined with his words, phrases of Potana’s
composition in an artistic manner. In Gopikahridayamu the author
described the Madhuredihdkti (sweet devotion) and Advai*akhoktt
(the union of the devotee, Jivatma and the supreme spirit).
Vedikolu is an ardent prayer for mundane boons and spiritual
emancipation. Sraddhanjali is an elegiac tribute to the glory of
Chellapilla Venkata Sastri (the first Telu^u poet-laureate) on
the occasion of his d^nisc. In his Grahastavamu he invokes thi^
 NEW trends: EOBTRY                                              ^<0

 blessings of the nine planets, believed by the Hindus to be the
 custodians and controllers of the fortunes of men and other living^
 beings in the world. Every one of these poems is also a lyric with
 the projection of the author’s self in it.
    Vasanta Kumari Devi’s Sarhagamamu is of the type of Guruzada
 Raghava Sarma’s Kalpalata. There are in her poem the fancies
 of Yasodhara like Pensee, Reverie; it relates to the story of Gautama
Buddha and Yasodhara. The poetess exhibits her poetic talent
and scholarship in this p^'cin.
   Anjali by Kavi Sekhara Pantufe Lakshmi Narayana Sastri is a
doxological poem in a dignified style. Sri Sukanasopadesamu by
D. V. Krishnamurti is an adaptation of an episode in Bana’s
Kadambari but reads like an original poem.
   jYissreyasamfidamu by Mutya Subbaraya Daivajnamani is a
didactic poem with poetic beauties and fine sentiments. This
poet is the author of some other poems of this nature such as
SamvardhanamUy Bhakiitatva Lahari and Hilaishivi.
   Ambalipudi Venkataratnam of Chanduru is a good Telugu
and Hindi scholar; ai d a j tnu to the voung writcis of that locality^
His poems, Maimdtviy Vatsaludu, Chandta sala^ Ptanqya vahini
etc., are stimulating.
   B. Chandramauli Sastri (1918) is a Sanskrit and Telugu
scholar. He has written many short poems, Jvala Toianam, Usha
Sri, Jmnabhiksha etc.
   Sii Ganesvariyamu by Kannepalli Sambasiva Ragliu Ramasvami
is a lengthy poem about the birth and life of Vighnesvara based
on traditional stories, composed in a dignified yet easy style.
   Katha Kadamhamu by Sannidhanam Suryanarayana Sastri is
as the name indicates, a collection of stories in verse which have
didactic importance.
   Svayam Prakasa Prabodham by Akkirazu Chandramauli Sarma
is a lengthy poem in an easy classical style with themes of devotiop.
and philosophical interest.
   Durganand is a poet who claims a place between the old and
the n^ poets. He is fond of maintaining old poetic conventions^
and conceits but is not in favour of old themes or old developments
of stories. He desires to introduce progressive ideas. He wrote
many short poems like Juna—as sweet as grape juice (a lyrical
poem); Manthara (Kaikeyi’s maid servant) ii} which the poet
paints the n\aid in b>ri|^t colours as a faithful servant and as the
 1204                                HISTORY OF TBLUOU UTSRATURB

 instrument for the subsequent story of Rama. His McuMika is
  of the old prahandha type with the theme of a sinit)le story of the
 love of Madhulika for a prince of Kosala and with many descrip¬
 tions characteristic of a prahandha. The progressive ideas of
 peace negotiations amidst war between the rulers of Kosala and
 Magadha through the intervention of Madhulika are interesting.
 The heroine, Madhulika is not of the royal family but of ordinary
 middle class society.
    Pranackatya Satavadhani Divi Rangacharyulu has recently
 published his Sri Krishnafimanushatvam (5 kandams) which is in
 the style of Potana’s Bhagavatam and is much appreciated.

               TRAMUTIOM FROM BENGALI—
                 RABINDRANATH’S POEMS


    The Telugu writers have been generally influenced by Bengali
 novels, short stories and poems, through their English versions.
 Some of them have learnt Bengali and attempted translations into
 Telugu, directly from the or rginals in Bengali, with varying success.
 Their appreciation of Rabindranath Tagore’s works is as intenshe
 as that of any other group of scholars in India and abroad. Some
 Telugu poems like Ekantasiva of Venkata Parvatisvara Kavulu
 reveal, in addition, the influence of the Radhakrishna cult and
 Madhurahhakti. Rayaprolu Subba Rao who had been for some
 time a disciple of Guru Dev at Santiniketan reveals the inspiration
 he derived from that world-famous poet.
    Of the Telugu translations of Tagore, either free or literal,
 mention should be made of Bezavada Gopala Reddi’s Kalidasu.
This poem is one of a series of Ck>pala Reddi’s renderings under
the caption Ravindra Sahityamu. Along with Kalidasu appears
also the translation of Rabindranath’s Smarana in memory of
Mrinalini Devi, the poet’s wife, who passed away in 190C. I learn
that these are very faithful translations. To those that are not
acquainted with the original Bengali poems, they give valuable
guidance for an appreciation of the poetical talent of Tagore.
   But Gopala Reddi’s poems are not in any metrical form though
the lines are shown as in a verse. They do, however, contain
acme rhythm, along with the dignity of expression and the flow
of classical verse. Some modem poets ha^e a fancy for such
poetic prose. Gangadhara Rama lUo, (Yovaraja of Fithapuram),
 NEW TEINDS: POETRY                                               205

  a scholar of English, Telugu and Sanskrit, has composed short
  Telugu poems of the modern as well as of the classical type. He-
 is a man of poetic conceits and admirable ideals and ideas. In
 his Kamarahitam (without a name) he used poetic prose and in the
 introduction he says: “ I have'^attempted to exhibit, in a strange
 muse which is neither prose nor poetry, new ideas and, in three
 (few) words, thirty flashes and three hundred ideas of cordialityr
 But I have no satisfaction.”

         (j) Poetry of Manipravala Type (Telugu mixed up with
               expressions of one or more other languages)

    Palakuriki Somanatha Kavi (of the early decades of the 13th
 Cfntury) is the earliest poet who composed in his Panditaiadhya
 Chaiitra some lines of the manipiavala t)pe. But he did not mix
 up expressions of cliflcient languages in one and the same sentence.
 He devoted some lines to Kannada and some to Marathi. Allasant
 Peddana’s Chain (a lengthy verse of al out 30 lines, said to be an
 extemporaneous out-burst) in the court of Krishnadevaraya,
 devoted about 16 lines to “pure” Telugu language and about
 16 lines to Sanskrit expressions—^words and compounds. It was
 meant to define and illustrate the features of goed poetry. But
this kind of mixing Telugu and Sanskrit is not tegarded as poetry
 of the manipravala t\pe.
   There aie a few Vaggeyakaras (Poet-musicians) who have a
fancy for songs with stanzas composed in several languages. I
quote below a Shad-bhasha Kirtana to illustrate this inteiesting type.
Pitambara~dhaiavast is the burden of the song, and this can enter
into each stanza of the six languages as it is a Sanskrit compound.
The names of the Haga and Tala aie also mtntioned. I do not
know the name of the author of this song.

  Some of the Abhyudaya (progressive) poets of this century have
composed poems in which English words have been profusely
used; one poet, Rajanikanta Rao (Pusha, j>en-name) says that
there is no need for poetry or art and that we should forget
the past, and foster revolt and anarchy:—
jiBw trends: poetry               .                              207

         Forget every yesterday
         Don’t think of the last minute.




         The italicised \\'ords are Telugu.

   Such a mad fancy for mixing up languages existed in the past
also. There is a popular verse, the authorship of which is not
known. It was probably composed by one who knew Sanskrit
and Telugu.

         “ Tandulalu griham —andu nasanti
         Tindik-ailc padunandi vasanli."




  The italicised words arc Sanskrit and the icst are Telugu.
The odd feature in this verse is the use of nasanti and vasanti svhich
are completely inflected verbs meaning “ are not ” and “ aie
  Verses of the manipravala type may in some cases, amuse us but
they cannot be regarded as Telugu poetry.

                      SOME OTHER POETS

  There are still many more poets of some significance. It is
not possible here to refer to all of them even briefly. mie of
them have earned the appreciation of tlieii icadcis. I shall
mention a few such poets.
   Tummala Sitaramamurti Chaudari has been hailed by his
admirers as Abhinava Tikkana on account of his mastery of the
native Telugu idiom. His Parigapanta is deservedly famous for
its beautiful descriptions of rural life, and his Rashtra Ganamu is
reckoned among the more. important patriotic poems of this
period. Bx& Bapuji is a narrative in^verse of Gandhiji’s life,

       Jasti Venkata Narasayya (plO) and Dhulipala Venkata
    Subrahmanyam (1913) are twin^oets who composed poems and
    wrote dramas that exhibit enthusiiism for nationalistic movement^
    and egalitarian ideals. Etukuri Venkata Narasayya is regarded
    as a Kavihrahma and as a “ Gent per cent Andhra ” on account
    of his good poetic compositions in which he has expressed
    his love for Andhra, rural life and of heroes of the past in the
    Tclugu country. Koganti Durga Mallikarjuna Rao is another
    poet of nationalistic temperament. Jandhyala Papayya Sastri
    (1912) {Karuna Sri, his per-name) is a talented poet and a good
    scholar of Sanskrit, Telugu and Hindi. His poems are generally
    teeming with pathos or pathetic fallacies. In his Uttishtha, the
    inner voice wakes up the baby Gautama (Buddha) from his sleep..
    In his Prabodhamu, Krishna rouses in the dejected heart of Arjuna,
   righteous indignation against the Kauravas. Mudigonda Vira-
    bhadra Murti (1908) has composed several good poems, of which
    Andhra Kesari presents a good sketch of Tanguturi Prakasam with
    enthusiasm and emotion. Putalapattu Sri Ramulu Reddi is a
   good Telugu and Tamil scholar and has translated into Telugu
   verse, Kambaramayanam, a celebrated epic in Tamil. Nandirazu
   Ghalapati Rao is a scholar and poet and has been for many years
   editor of Grihalakskmt; his Mangalagiri Alahatmyam relating to the
   glory of the sanctuary at Mangalagiri near Vijayawada is almost
   of the type of classical poetry, but it exhibits modern ideas and
   ideals. Visvanatha Lakshmana Kavulu are twin-poets (Madirazu
   Visvanatha Rao and Kappagantula Lakshmana Sastri). Both
   of them arc great scholars of Sanskrit and Tclugu. They translated
  into Tclugu verse Vikramanka Deva Charitram while the same had
   been translated into Tclugu prose by Tirupati Vcnkatesvarulu.
      Burgula Ramakrishna Rao (1899-1967) is a polyglot with an
   aptitude to learn any new language in a short time; a good
   speaker and writer. Amidst varied activities—political and
  social—he could find time for literary work. His Panditarega
  Panchamritam, a recent publication, entitles him to a high rank
  as a Telugu poet. His earlier Krishna Satakam and Venkata
  Suprabhatam exhibit his devotion to God and his spiritual bent
  of mind. His essays illustrate his acquaintance with Telugu and
  Urdu literatures and his aptitude for literary criticism. ^
      G. Narayana Reddi (1931) is a young jjMoet with a promise to
. rise to the highest rank among the new poets of this age. Jalapatcm

 and Divvela mu&valu (the chiming bells of lights) are his early
 compositions, outbursts of his Iradiant thought. Among his
 lengthy poems, Nagarjuna sagaranJis a melodious kavj^a in varying
 metres with a theme of the Buddhist age in Andhra. Karpura
  Vasanta Rayalu is his master-pic^e. It is a lengthy poem relating
 to the greatness and pomp of Kumaragiri Rcddi, king ofKondavidu
 (1386-1402) who had the title of Karpura Vasanta Rayalu indicat¬
 ing the cultural and artistic merit he possessed. The author has
also written short dance dramas and all-verse plays like Vennelavada
(the moonlight scene) and Ajanta-sundariy well suited for per¬
formance on the stage. Ramappa is a short play in prose, verse
and song.
   There arc many other poets who have composed short poems
of merit such as Avantsa Venkata Ranga Rao author of Nelavanka
If&lrachaparm (crescent—^rainbow), Renduchintala Lakshmi Nara-
simha Sastri, author of Rajatarangini and some shoi t poems known
as Bhavagitamulu,

       New Trends in ModA'n Literature: Prose
Prose as a special brardi of literature is oflaUr          iji Tclugu,
as in all other languages. There arc, no doubt, shoit or faiily
long prose passages in cla.ssical poems fiom the time of Naiinasa^
the earliest known poet (11th century). But they weie all in the
Kavra dialect and roinposcd in a stsle consistent uith tlie style of
the vcises preceding and foUo-wing them. They aie geneially
in one long sentence, th.e clauses of which ate linked together
by conjunctions and past pai liciples. Tallapakaidii Vinkatesvara
 Vachnnalu aie in simple and ih> thmic prose in the AV      dialtct.
   Pn>se, as a branch of literature, flourished at Madluira under
the iJitronage of the Nayak rulers. Sai.nuklum Vcidata Kiish-'
nappa ^1701-1731) wiotc Jalmini Bharatam and               damfai’kara
Chaiiha in prose. The language used by him contains many
expressions from the spoken dialect. Prose litciature flouiished
also at Mysore. Kaluva Viraraju (1680-1750) wiote the lilaha-
bhnratam in prose in about 1730, and Nanjaraju, his own son,
wrote Halasya Makatmyam. I'heir prose is iji poetic diction.
   There were aho many other prose works in other parts of the
Telugu country and they could be classed under sevcial heads,
such as Puranic stories, stories from Tclugu classics, stories of
ethical or didactic value, Pliilosophical discourses, Essays, Biogra¬
phies of saints and devotees, lengthy letters by pandits on oriental
Sastraic discussions etc. They were all written, not in the poetic
dialect but in the language in which pandits had their oral dis¬
 cussions—more or less in the popular dialect with some Sanskritic
 expressions in keeping with the dignity of the subject. The
 Christian missionaries encouraged the use of the popular dialect,
 particularly in the case of Christian Literature and all books
 intended to popularise the Christian faith in the country. Ravipati
 Gurumurti Sastri wrote, in the spoken dialect, the stories of
 Vikramarka in 1819 and the stories from the Panchatantra in 1834.
 The College Board instituted at Madras got them and similar
 books, printed and prescribed as text-books in schools. Three
 brothers of the Paturi family were connedfeed with the Government

 as models to be followed. His lianslalions fitm Erglish woiks,
 such as Lamb’s           Tales from Shakcspeaie and Huxley’s
physiology showed hosv useful they could be to the Telugu
jreaders. Following the example set by Viiesalingam, the Religious
4ract and Book Society published Talnkum Prayanam a Telugu

translation of Banyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress.         The Christian
Literature Society, Madras, published in 1892 a Telugu translation
of some stories of England. Tlr* Vijnana Chandrika Grantha Mala
started in 1907 undeitook to publish translations of useful books
from English literature. Mill’s Liberty was translated by Duggirala
Ramamurti. Prose woiks of this century will be noticed in the
subsequent sections in thcii appiopriate places.

                          (a) Fiction—Novels

    The very word N'amla, used in Teliigu to denote Novel, shows
 that Fiction is of a lairr otiqin in Telugu. It is one of the most
 important new trends in modein Telugu liteiatuie that may be
 regarded as the tesiih of the iiifliMMice of Fuglish on Telugu litera¬
 ture. There hul been, pir\iou'h, lengthy tales and storks like
 Kathamriimoaiam, Sukn^'Mali a - d Ilam^mimmli. But they were
simple narratives fioni the begii\ning to the cud, like the Fairy
 tales in England and oihei rountil^’s in the past. The novel
 evolved from such t.ilcs with a special technique. It is a lengthy,
imaginary story, with dcsci iptions of scenes connected to the story,
narration of cs'ents, and dialogues. Novels may be social or
historical. Social novels are mainly imaginary. Historical novels
arc no doubt based on historical facts, but they arc not mere
chronicles. Their development is in accordance with the imagina¬
tion of the author, although the authors do not generally distort
historical facts. They interpret the characteristic traits of the
historical personages, and may create new characters to help the
progress of the story, or to support the author’s interpretation.
During the second half of the 19th century, young men who had
received English education and had consequently become
acquainted with English literature, entertained the idea of venting
novels like the English novels. Viresalingam Pantulu claimed,
in his autobiography, that he was the first novelist in Telugu
literature and referred to his Rajasekhara Ckaritra published in
 1878. Probably he was not aware of the existence of the novel,
known as Sri Rangaraja Ckaritra by Narahari Gopala Krishnamma
 Ghetti published in 1872 with an introduction in which he says
*‘This attempt to delineate the manners and customs of the
 Telugus in their own language in the form of a novel, owes iti
 origin to the announcement by the late lamented Viceroy of die
  wm    trends: prose                                                 213
   offer of a reward for the best storjl in Bengali, illustrative of native
   life and manners in lower Bengal/ ^nd the author therefore deems
   it a privilege (deeply as he regret tnat he cannot do so in person)
   to inscribe to Lord Mayo, in/token of respectful and grateful
   appreciation of his Lordship’s endeavours to promote the literary
   culture of the Vernaculars of India, this slight cflort to further,
   in however small a degree, the same cause         This was an original
   novel based on certain historiccil developments in the annals of
   Vijayanagar. But the story is original. It relates to the marriage
   of the hero with a Lamhadi gii 1 Sonabaf.
      Rajasekhara Charitra of Vircsaliiigam is, though not quite a
  translation, based on Goldsmith’s Vicar of Wakefield. Thcie
  is a great similarity between Rajasekhara and Dr. Primrose, and
  between Sri Krishna Jagapati Raju and Sii William Thornhill
  in their characteristic traits. There is also similarity between
  some incidents and developments in the story of Rajasekhara Charitra
  and those of the English novel. It is a social novel and it was
  well received by the readers and reviewed in the journals of those
  days. The Hindu said “This is the fust Telugu novel. This
  attempt in a new direction is a success... ” A very interesting
 feature about this is the tianslatiou of this novel into English by
 T. R. Hutchinson svho chose to give it the title “ Fortune’s Wheel
  It was also furnished with attractive illustrations. 11 was published
 in 1887 and in the same year reviewed in London Times, which
 said, “ The story itself is simple and, from the European point of
 view, of no great interest. But the pictures of Hindu domestic
 life, religious ideas, mode of worship and superstitions, and the
 condition of women with denial of all rights of choice in marriage,
 are so well drawn and illustrated that the book will have a charm
 for all readers ”.
     Viresalingam wrote subsequently a shorter novel, Satyavatu
charitra for women to instruct them in the ideals of domestic and
social life. Later on he wrote Satyaraja Parva Desayatralu on the
 model of Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels, with the background of Hindu
life and ideas.
    He did not content himself with writing novels. With the
object of encouraging the growth of the novel in Telugu, he
instituted, in co-operation with Nyapati Subba Rao of the same
place, Rajahmundry, the award of prizes under the auspices of
Chintofnani (Tehigu Journal) which Subba Rao had been editing.

The stories of the heroes and heroines of the early Mohammadan

for historical novels. Vclala Subha ^ao wTotc Rani Samyukta

known as Bnlakaii) weie more prominent in the field. The
former wrote si‘cial as well as historical novt'ls. Lakshmi Piasndam

   Beng.*’ c.ovcls, particularly those of Bankim and Sarat, attracted
the Teiugu leaders. ^Vheu it is said that Rabindranath, Aurobindo
and Afah ama Gandhi were inspired by Bankim’s novels, there
is no Wtindcr if the d’elugus, like many others in India, desired to
read them in their own language. The religion of patriotism,
as Aurobindo said, was preached by Bankim through his novels.

     Sarat’s novels became, in c 'urse of time, even more popular
   in the Telugu country. Chalrapani and the eminent scholar
   Veluri Sivarama Sastri translated a few novels of Saiat. Siva-
  sankara Sastri also translated sonib Bengali novels. Rabindranath
  Tagore’s novels also attracted the Telugu scholars. His Home
  and Abroad was translated by K. Vaikuniha Rao and published
  by Vavilla. There have been translations of novels from other
  languages during the last thirty years. It may be safely said that
  translations arc larger in number than original novels in Telugu;
  and among translations tiiose from English are comparatively few.
     Mosalikanti Sanjiva Rao wrote a novel known as Savjwi as an
  adaptation of Scott’s Talisman with an Indian baclgroui d. Literal
  translations of Scott’s novels also appeared—Ivanhoe, Kenilworth
  and Quentin Durward. Katuri and Pingali (twin pnets’' j(.intly
 translated Bug-Jargal of Victor Hugo and Katuri translated the
 Black Tulip of Alexander Dumas. Mosalikanti Sanjiva Rao
 wrote Antahpurapranayam as an adaptation ( f Loves < f the Harem
 by Reynolds. Veduruinudi Seshagiri Rao’s Stri Sahasam is also
 an adaptation of another novel by Reynolds.
     We have also adaptations of some French novels. Ch.
 Kamesvara Rao’s Prema Smdari and Veluri Sivarama Sastri’s
 Divyajivanamu are adaptations of Lcs Miserablcs. Chinta Dikshi-
 tulu’s Rajagiri Raju is an adaptation of Count de nv nle Cristo
 of Alexander Dumas. Paramananda Charilra of Mocherla ITanu-
 manta Rao is an adaptation of Don Quixote. Thei e have been
similar translations in recent years such as Svechcha patham (Freedom
path) by Asvinikumar Dutt from a novel by Howard Faust.
    There have been also adaptations of some Russian novels. Many
works of Tolstoy, Gorky, Chekov, Pushkin, and others, have been
rendered into Telugu. Tummala Venkataramayya, a progressive
writer connected with the Visalandhra Publications, translated a
novel of Gorky, known as Matru hridayamu. Dodla Venkata Rami
Reddi wrote Kalavati as an adaptation of Ghandu Menon’s Indulekha
in Malayalam. Krottapalli Surya Rao wrote adaptions of Amira
Hamzat Hasane Azayab besides original novels like Guna Sundari.
    But more important than these translations are original novels
which mirror the social life of the Telugu country. Unnava
Lakshminarayana was one of the earliest to write an original
novel in this century. He was an advocate of the modem Telugu
movement, and his novel, Malapdli, is throughout written in the
  KBW trends: prose                                                   217
    living language with dialectal f variations appropriate to the
    characters. It occupies the same lofty position, among Telugu
    novels, which Kanyasulkam do/s among Dramas. The author
    was an art-lover, scholar, socAl reformer and nationalist. His
    novel presents the current ruial life of the Telugu country and
    portrays the characters in charming colours with a touch of
    idealism. Mokkapati Narasimha Sastri whose love of humour
    and genial temper are reflected in his features and in his lively
   conversation, wrote a very humorous novel, known as BarrUter
    Parvatisam in which he portrays the cHaiactcr of simpletons who
   brag and are incapable of achieving success. The author has
   a remarkable talent for creating typical characters w’hose names
   become proverbial. The humour in Parvatisam is more refined
   than wh.it is displayed in similar novels Venkatadas or Ganapati
   by othci writers.
      Visvanatha Satyanarayana is one of the few master novelists of
   the present age. He is a scholar, poet, playwright and novelist
   as well as a short story writer. In every one of his works, he shows
  his love for the mother country, for Hindu Dharma, and for pro¬
  gress on national lines. His novels reveal all these features and
  are at the same time thought provoking and inspiring. He dislikes
  westernisation in social life, manners and customs, and even mere
  so in literature. Consequently he did not like to translate novels
  from English or any other language. But he is a liberal and is
  not averse to the technique of the novel or the short story which
 developed in Telugu literature through our contact with English
 literature; nor is he against the adoption of what is good in foreign
 culture, to the extent to which it promotes our culture according
 to our ideals of life. We may also say that in spite of his nationalistic
 bias, the plots and development of his novels as well as some of
 the ideas expressed in them reveal touches of foreign taste. Veyi
 Padagalu (thousand hoods) is the best and the most voluminous
 of his novels. His Cheliyalikatta (the Seashore) is a novel of the
 sentiments and ideals of Hindu life. The elopement of a young
 man with his brother’s wife is the central theme, and their romance
«nds with courting death after they realise their sin. In Baddanna
 Senanif the heroine is represented as older than the hero, a concep¬
tion borrowed from what prevails in the West. Jebudongalu (pick¬
pockets) has psychological interest with characters cherishing
ideas varying with their nature and experience. Ekavira is a

 Hnhahiihu is a short novel dcsignal to ridicule modern sciences like
 philology and anthropology, ^mrganiki nichchenalu (ladders to
 heaven) another short novel, exposes the credulity of the people,
 and shows how soin''' false       and pietcnders to knowledge work
 upon credulous pci sons, sometimes with alarming success. The
dcsciiptions exhibit the acquaintance of the author with vaiious
phasc', of oriental culture, but they arc sometimes too long and
run into several ptgt*,, efiverting the interest of the readers from
 the main theme. But in spite of these frailties, which I notice in
 the novels of manv others also, it must be said that Satyanarayana
 is ore of the gicatest novelists of the picscnt generation in Tclugu
 Liter atuic.
    Adivi Bapirazu is another novelist who deserves to be ranked
hieh on account of his originality in the conception of ph>ts and
artistic skill in developing them. \Vc notice the influence of
English novels on his thoughts and aitislic ci cation. Being a
fervent patriot, he was eager to main tain the supcrioiit) of Indian
and, particularly Andhra, culture; but he would not Iie'>itate to
admire the good elements of foreign culliuc. Narqyana Rao is his
mastcr-piecc in wLich he portrays th^’ contemporary social life
of the Tclugu country. Nafayana Rao, the hero of the story is the
creation of Bapirazu and is presented as a representative Andhra,
virtuous and noble minded. Himahin rt is a histoiical novel with
a desciiption of Andhra life in the Satasaliana period as envisaged
by the author aftci a study of the liteiature of that period. Four
love episodes are \\'o\cn into the stoiy. The conflict between the
Vcdic religion and Buddhism, and the blight features of Andhra
culture are described. Gom Ganna Riddi is another historical novel
which depicts the life and culture of the Tclugus during the
Kakatiya period.
    Bapirazu used, like Unnava Lakshminarayana, appropriate
spoken language varying with the characters. He is also eager
to exhibit his scholarship and sometimes deliberately invents,
occasions for-that purpose.
  Nori Narasimha Sastri is one among the best novelists of this,
modern age. Like Visvanatha Satyanarayana he chooses to write
his novels in classical language. He is Ibnd o€ legendary and
historical plots. His J^araymabhattUt RudfoUa Z>m''ahd Mdla Reddi

 novels of the day. They reveal the social life of the picsent
generation and the ideas and ideals of various tspes of pci sons.
 They impel the reader to a stiuh of the humrn mind w-hen it is
 subject to a conflict of the piesent and past idc-^i-j and ethical
 values.
   During the 'hirtie and foitie-. of iliis centui\, iios el wiiting was
reduced to the level ol .i comtnc-fidl I usiness.         blithers could
purchase the copyright of a novel foi fifty rupees, and there were
shrc\/d writers who could produce a novel in a couple of days.
With some interesting scenes and incidents whicii they had come
across in the stories they had read, thev could cleverly manipulate
an apparently new story like the kaleidoscope. There arc thrills^
loves, jealousies, appointments and disappointments enough to
 amuse the readers. This art of wiiting nov-cls i*- like the ex¬
 temporaneous outbui-st of veises in poetry and is, therefore,
entertaining. But they are of tempoiary interest and intended
for light and cheap amusement. Kowali Laksliminarasimha
 Rao and Jampana Chandrasekhara Rao and -omc others wrote
many novels of this type. A few of them had some artistic merit-
 Whatever their value as literature might be, they were sold in
large numbeis—particulatly on the Railway platfoims, because
they could afford delight to the rcadci s like a fleeting picture.
    Young men of the present generation have been writing short
novels that may be classed under Detective stories but their work,
is still in the experim,ental stage. They arc inspired by Sir Arthur
Conan Dayle of Sherlock Holmes fame, Eric Stanley Gardner
with’ Perry Mason, the d^ective .and Agatha Christe«
   There are also novelettes intended for school children. They

 are mentioned here because tiiey have artistic ^merit. Nelaturi
 Venkataramanayya’s Paschattapam relates to the story of Krishna*
 devaraya and his repentance foil the cruel punishment accorded
 to Timmarasu without sufficient justification. Dalavayi Ramappqyya
 of Ghalla Radhakrishna Sarma is a historical novel dealing with
 the life and work of Dalavayi Pradhani Ramappayya. V. Jaya-
 rama Reddi’s Premanauka illustrates what is meant by pure love
 and by disinterested friendship.
    Devarakonda Chinni Krishna Saima’s Vijayi is a short novelette,
 intended to illustrate the tareeis of two brothers born of the same
 parents, who yet may differ in character. One of them flourishes
 and becomes victorious, though he had to face difficulties, through
 his goodness, and the other ruins himself through his wickedness.
    G. V. Krishna Rao’s Kilu Bommalu (puppets) is a novel which
illustrates how innocent people aie ruined and are subject to
 misery by the chicanery and machinations of the clever people in
 villages, which are now bereft of old traditional unity or
 morality.
    Illindra Rangana> akulu is a gifted novelist. As an interpreter
-of contemporary social life, he is in the line of Chilakamarti,
 Unnava and Bapirazu. His Ramanamurti presents a vivid picture
of the days of the salt satyagrahas and of the currents and cross-
•currents in Andhra politics and society.

                          (b) Short Stories

   There were many short and fairly lengthy stories in Telugu,
long before the short story with its modern technique came into
vogue. Madhira Subbanna Deekshitulu published in popular
Telugu, the widely current traditional Kasimajili Katkdu (Banaras
pilgrim) at Rajahmundry in 1905-8 in four volumes. About the
same time, Nandirazu Chalapati Rao (1878) editor of Manjmani
at Eluru, a prolific writer and publisher of several classics and
rIso a poet, published a refined version of these pilgrim stones
under the caption of Nijamaim (real) KasimajUi Kathalu attributing
their author^ip to an avadhuta.
   There were also stories from Panckatantra and KeUhasaritsagaria
and Tataehari and Tenali RamaUnga stories. During 1820*<-S0
Yerramilli Mallikarjunudu of Visakhapatgam, a didihadu wrote
NSW trends: rrose                                                  221
 Char-darvesh stories (Persian stories). In recent years, scholars
 like Veluri Sivarama Sastri and Sivasankara Sastri and his son,
 Krittivasa-Tirthulu have translated the Jataka and other stories
 from Pali and Prakrit as ri^ell as from Katha Saritsagara.
     But the short story, of the modern type began with Gurazada
 Venkata Appa Rao’s Mata-Manti (Chit-chat); but he wrote very
 few short stories. They were published* in a Telugu Journal
 {Trilinga) at Madras in 1910-11. In a short time, the art of
 writing stories made rapid progress. Gudipati Venkata Ghalam
 (popularly known as Ghalam) excelled Appa Rao both in quality
 and quantity and went a step further in making greater use of the
 spoken dialect. His prose style is vigorous and powerful. But
 he violated at several places the canons of decorum in attempting
 i D present the incidents of his stories with stark realism. He is-
 very courageous in exposing social evils and ridiculing the prejudices-
 and superstitions of the people., He chooses for his themes ordinary
incidents of life—cither of the rich or the middle class, or the poor
and the oppressed. Stories like Naidu Girl are perfect in technique
He studies the works of the master story writers of the West, like
 Maupassant, Alexander Kuprin and Lawrence. He translated
some of the stories of Maupassant. From Kuprin he learnt to
sympathise with fallen and discarded womanhood. From Law¬
rence he learnt to solve the sex problems. But in adapting them,
he clothed Indian characters in a foreign garb—^with alien ideas,
 manners and customs.
    In course of time several brilliant story writers appeared, and
though they might have been inspired by the short stories of the
west, they succeeded in varying degrees in presenting stories that
were genuinely Indian and to a large extent, Telugu. For want
of space I shall mention, only about twenty-five writers that are
prominent.
    Ghinta Dikshitulu was inspired by the world’s best stories. Hit
outlook was that of a serene observer of humanity. His stories
for children will be noted under Juvenile section. The stories
that he has woven round the “ Ladies Cultural Club ” are very
humorous and inoffensively satiricial. He wrote also a novel,
Rajagmrajtt in 1913. His SUapratima is very touching. It illi»*
trates the spirit of self-sacrifice of a man who offered himself for
the customary human sacrifice required in olden days when a
castle or a pahtce was built* Even more admirable was the

 from the ears of the bull in two streams, one towards Anga and
 another towards Videha and the and land became fertile. The
•story was wrought as an admirable work of ait.
    Adivi Bapirazu (1895-1952) was also an adept in writing stories.
Of his stories Vina and Vana Sire the best. In his Vina, he develops
 the themes of beauty and music, joy and meditation. The mutual
 love of Premabala and Anandamurti, the disappointment of
 Premabala who felt that Anandamurti cared more foi hxs Vina^
 the snapping of the strings of the Vina (Vallaki Bala), Ananda-

  hero and the heroine were a loving couple. A rich landford
  coveted their lands, and when they declined to part with them,,
  he got the hero imprisoned on a false chaigc. But ultimately
 the hero and heroine triumphed. The comenations are in the
  dialect of the characters and they are very chaiming,
    Suravaram Pratapa Rcch’’, whose Andhula Sanghika Clantra
  (Social History of thcAnciIiras), w'on posthumoisly, the first awaid
 of the Sahitya Akademi, also wrote some good short stoiics of
 which MHkshana is the best. It is based on a local tradition about
 Kanyakumari (Gape Comoiin) now woi shipped as a g« ddess
 at the southern-most point of India. The heroine of this stoiy
 is Kanya and the hero is Sankaran, a fisheimaii who used to go
every morning to the deep sea to catch fish and icturn home in the
 evening. Kanya used to go to the seashoie to see him off in the
 morning and again in the e\ c ning to welcoinc him with a pot of
 food. One day he did not icluin. She waiird and waited and
 returned home disappointed. She continued to go to the seashoie
 every evening with focvl and leave it theie. And this she did till
 her death in hei sixtieth yeat; and she was ci^'mated at the very
spot where she had waited for Sankaran day after day.
    Veluri Sivarama Sastri (1892—1967) has not only translated
several novels of Sarat directly from Bengali, but has also wiitten
many shortstories. ' The themes are based on tales of ancient India,
but developed as consummate works of ait. His Tanma\ata is
based on a story from KathasariUagara. It deals with the infatuation
of the son of a rich merchant for a princess* who respond} in a
kindly and digniSed manner. The story indicates that no hurdle
can stand in the way of lovers when the mind is completely
absorbed in the object of love and that carnal love develops into
spiritual love.
    His Depression Ckembu (copper pot) relates to the pitiable
state ofuncmploymcnl even in’the case offirst class M.A’s. It repre»
sents the phases of expectation and disappointment. Th** fii&t is
described with a touch of humour and the second with pathos.
It illustrates the uncomplaining endurance of the mother, the
endurance of the wife accompanied by an inward struggle, and
the utter recklessness of the young man, during adversity. When
finally the young man goes out to borrow more money, his wife
goes out with the begging poWjust to show him that it is not wise
to bonow' whar cannot 'bt‘ repaid.^

    Malladi Ramakrishna Sastri (1906—1965) is a good scholar of
 Sanskrit and Telugu and has written about two hundred short stories^
 many of which have been published in the Telugu journals. He has
 a unique style of his own; he leaves gaps in his narration and
 expects his readers to fill them by an effort of imagination. His
 stories generally exhibit deep thought, realistic conception and
 strong imagination. His dti mu vu lu (terminations of nouns in
 Telugu in the nominative case) is very interesting. The title of
 the story illustrates the individuality of the author in giving peculiar
 names. This title suggests that we aie all subject to a drift in the
 course of our life. The story is based on a traditional theme,
 connected with the unfinished last line of a verse in Tikkana’s
 Telugu Makabkarata. The words “ guru natha! ” which Tikkana
 heard, aptly suited the occasion and the poet closed the verse
 with these words. Gurunatha was the name of Tikkana’s half-
 brother, the son of his father Kommana, by a Sudra maid who
crossed in high floods on a rainy day. Kommana was going to
the river. He could not proceed further on account of rain and
darkness. Twenty years later, that woman died and in her last
moments she told her son about his birth and urged him to meet
his father and his half-brother, Tikkana. When Kommana
addressed his son as “ Gurunatha ”, Tikkana used those words
in his verse in the sense of Kurunatha (“ k ** becomes ** g ” in
sandhi). They suited well in the sense of “ OI Lord of Kurus t ”
The story is well conceived and attractively developed.
   Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao (1909) is a prolific writer of
sketches, features and talks for the Radio and novelettes like
Savati talli (step-mother) which was translated into several languages
and broadcast from the Radio Stations. He is a journalist and
writer of Film scripts. He has published his stories in twelve
volumes, and also six novelettes. He has adapted some stories
from English and Russian Fiction. His Kaihasagar and Adqfanm
(birth as woman) and Akkapelli are some of his best stories. AJdca>>
pelli (elder sister’s marriage) reveals the conflict of ideas in many
families regarding the selection of the bridegrooms, and the dis¬
agreement between the father and mother and between the parents
and their daughters. It is a charming story.

 versatile literary talent and activities as a script writer for the
 Film and the Radio. He has written many novelettes, short
 plays and short stories. His writings are flavoured with humour
 and arouse interest. Hfc is fond of realism in developing any
story, particularly when he depicts rural life.
    His Bharyalone undi (it is only in the wife), Tandrula-Kodukulu
 (fathers and sons) are very interesting. His Samptngapmvu
 (Ghampaka flower) is one of his original stories which icvcals the
creative imagination of a writer well acquainted with human
 nature and the present state of society subject to a conflict of
 ideals and ideologies—traditional and progressive. This story
illustrates the behaviour of a highly cultured Hindu lady whom
 her husband and some other cultured persons can understand,
 but who is mistaken by the people of a place, which is neither a
 city nor a village, for an ultra-modern lady or one of questionable
 morality. Even the person whom she deemed the best among
her acquaintances there proved to be imperfect because he could
 not understand why she gave him the champ aka flower in the
 Cinema hall.
    Mokkapati Narasimha Sastri (1892) is known as a humourous
writer. Besides Barristar Parvattsam already noticed and Subba-
 rayadu Belli (marriage of Subbarayudu) a drama, he wrote several
short stories like Kannavi Vtnnavi (what arc seen and heard),
Akharu mafa (last word). In almost all his stories, it is the stupid
simplicity of the hero that laigely contributes to the humour in
the story, and the author is an adept in depicting characters and
incidents in a realistic manner. His Akharu mate is the story of a
 man who led a depraved and dissolute life, earned a fortune by
cornipt means and lost it through extravagance, and finally
committed suicide in a fit of lepentance. In his last letter to hia
son, he regrets his depraved life, and gives parting ad\ice to him
to lead a virtuous life.
    Munimanikyam Narasimha Rao (1898) is highly appreciated
all over the Telugu country for the consummate humour displayed
in all hi^ works. He has written a few novels like Vakrarekha and
a few dramas like Grikapravesam but he is much better admired
for his short stories which have been published, in several short
volumes. He docs not generally go beyond the middle-class
domestic life for his themes. His Kantam (lit “ dear wife **) is.
always associated with him, as is evidenced by the names he gives.

 to his stories—Aaff/ofR Kathaiu, Nmu Jita Kantm (I and my doaf
wife) Kantam Kaijiyatkf Kantam kapuram (Kantam^ domestic li6s)»
 etc. The humour which runs through his stories is mild, inoffensive
 and suggestive, and never vulgar. His Pillalu gala illu (a house
 with children) is very interesting both to the young and the old. It
 narrates the experiences of a relative who is a guest for a day.
 The water in the bath-room had been made dirty by the children;
salt or dust had been thrown into his food, unnoticed by the mother;
his liir/rle had been slightly damaged by them during his absence*
The guest never complained, but the parents came to know what
the children had done. The guest left the house, and thou^
he w s c vpected to return in the evening he did not. When the
hous<*-\\'ilc felt surprised, her husband said, “How can he stay
in s I li    house as this^ “ She rejoined, “ Should he not know
thit II I i house with children?’’.
   T I I      »i First Casf> he refers to a funnv incident in the caieer
of i     ' ’'is irancc agent. To srcuie his first rase, he attanp*
to indu « a young passenger to insure his life. This leads to an
uglv s^'cuc in the third class compartment of a running train.
The young man was subject to some mental disorder, and when
he thought of the possibility of premature death cited by the agent
as a plea for insurance, he began to weep! The agent was on the
point of being attacked by the fellow-passengers for causing distress
to the young man; but he managed to escape unhurt by jumpii^
down at a wayside station. He too was taken for a lunatic!
   Sivxrazu Venkata Subba Rao—{Butchi Babu^ his pen-nameJ
(1916—1967) has literary taste and versatality. Besides his novel
Chivaiiki mi^ilediy his drama Uttama Illalu (the virtuous house-wife)
and pi i> $ and playlets, his sketches for the Radio, he has written
severil''short stories, Meda Metlu (the stair-case), Adavim Kac^a

with whom he came into contact. The man was never inclined
to answer it ,* he would avoid it in various ways. Finally he retired

   'Ute themes are quite ordinary but his presentaion of them is
   •extra-ordinary; they give the readers an insight into the individual
    and social life. He starts the story, Putrasantmamu with the usual
   wish of the parents to have a son rather than a daughter. But
   they beget, in quick succession, three daughters but no son. They
   curse their fate and look down upon the third daughter as if she
   was the sinner. Great is their joy when at last, they have a son and
   It is enhanced wh'»n their fifth child is»also a son. The sons are
  “brought up with an excess of doting affection and in the end the
  parents are reduced to poverty and have to be supported by their
  daughters in their old age.
      Balivada Kanta Rao (1927) has written, besides a short novel,
  ‘Godamiii Bomma^ several stoiies. Arthabhagalalo Bhinna hridayalu
   (different heaits in the halves of the persons), and Sramtkulu
   (labourers and woikmen) arc short pieces. Lokam^ Buchi (a
  fearful thing mentioned to fiighten children), Annapurna^ Parajqyanti
   and Suguna arc comparatively longer ones. In Lokam^ the present
  day conflict between the old fashioned father and his children,
  in the matter of women acquiring school and college education
   and earning their livelihood, is well portrayed. The story has
   been so well developed that the old father, who hated his third
 daughter for her obstinacy in attending college, is finally nursed
  by that girl; and he says, “ I am sorry for my narrow mindedness;
 1 should have had my first two daughters also well-educated.”
     P\ntula Srirama Sastri (1922) has written two playlets one of
  which received a prize in a competition organised by All India
  Radio, and about 60 short stories. In Badhyata (responsibility)
  the author adopted the new technique of developing a story,
-through chronologically arranged letters. It shows how a develop**
 Ing matrimonial alliance fails to fructify, and how the elderly
 people (a widow and a widower) involved in that proposed alliance
 unexpectedly get married without any ado.

 a house with the amount, but his wife had wished to use it for the

 purchase a motor bicycle. The old man was finally obliged to-
 sell the house to have domestic peace, and this was done just
 as he was dying. But he had been worried and his health had
 deteriorated. His widow and children then repent for having
 caused him mental agonv.
    Kommuri Padmavati Dpvi (1908) came to prominence on the-
stage and in the films. She has learned Kannada and English.
She takes a leading part in cultural activities relating to \\ omen’s

of Anandavam —well known Tclugu journals. She was a joint
editor of a Journal, Nataka Kala along with me in 1940-41. She-
has written many shoit stories of Avhich the Poqada danda{a. garland

danda is a pathetic story of a girl, Sita, who was so fond of Vakula
flowers that she used to go, on her way back from school, to the
temple yard to gather them. A young man, Sankaram, noticed
her and, with mad infatuation, would present her garlands of
flowers. She innocently received them, but never revealed this-
to her aunt, in whose house she had been staying. She developed
a liking for him, though she did not agree to marry him. She
was then sent to her grandparents’ house, where she was married
to another man. This was a disappointment to Sankaram who
turned a lunatic. When a few days later Sita returned to her
taunt’s house, he noticed her, and taking her in to bis arms, ran
to the edge of a tank and covered her with passionate kisses.   This,
created a sensation and before people gathered in larger numbers,
Sita had fallen into the tank and was drowned. She evidently
committed suicide unable to face public ridicule.
   Illindala Sarasvati Devi (1915) is a highly cultured lady and has
been writing stories such as Panduga bahamanam and Jaivatnmiw^
She has also translated into Telugu the biografdty of Gandhi
from an English version. Her Anasvasita is fine story of a woman
who, sometime after her husband’s death, travelled in a train
her daughter’s house to attend the birthilky celebration of her

 grandson. She was a woman of very few words and did not lijke
  to associate herself with strangers either in the train or in th^
 •daughter’s house. She was developing a sort of resignation.
  Alter the birthday function was over, the grandson had fever and
 ahe attended on him. After his recovery, she disappeared one
  night leaving a letter in which she wrote that she bequeathed all
 her property to her grandson and that she was going to render
 service as a nurse in a Nursing Home or Hospital* Her spmewhat
 unusual traits arc well portrayed in the story,
     Narla Venkatesvara Rao besides many playlets, has also written
some short stories of which Sabhyata (decency) relates how some
 heartless officers of high rank illtreat their domestic servants and
 neglect them even if, while rendering service, they nueet with
 accident and become maimed. Such unfortunate servants
 develop the idea that begging is nobler than serving such masters.
     Kanuparti Varalakshmamma’s Ottu (a solemn promise) is also
illustrative of want of cultuie and decency on the part of some
 members of the upper class in our society. Jagannatham, a
 prominent member of a Dramatic club, and foremost in proposing
 that the members should persuade their wives to act on the stage
 created an ugly scene when one night his wife, acting as Ghitrangi,
was about to embrace Sarangadhara on the stage.
    Kappagantula Satyanarayana’s short stories, some of which
have been published in the Telugu Journals such as Bharatif are
interesting sketches of human thoughts and aspirations. His story
Evariki Varena illustrates the lack of courtesy among some young
people. It is about three retired officers—one Pantulu» one
 Naidu and one Saheb (Musalman) who were meeting every
evening at the beach in Madras and sitting on a bench opposite
the University Examination Hall in Triplicane. One day,
Pantulu did not come, and noticing his absence, some young man
remarked within the hearing of the remaining two friends,
    Probably he died; he was a very old Inan        The two friends
felt shocked. On the next day evening, Pantulu came and his
two friends were absent. The same young man looked at him
and said within the hearing of this old man,           Yesterday we
thought that this man was dead, but he is alive. Probably ha
two friends died        Pantulu w^s shocked to hear their semark.
The tragedy was that all the three friends died on the nCxt dsfy*

   ^ormka (the parrot and the myna) has a great moral to be
  learnt by man from beasts. On one and the fame night, one
  of the two cows of a landlord died after yearning a calf and the
  wife of the servant looking after the cow died after she had been
  delivered of a child. While the other cow was affectionately
  suckling the motherless calf, the landlord’s wife looked down upon
  the motherless child of the faithful servant. But in the course
  of a few days, the woman noticed the tender affection displayed
  by the cow and learnt from this beast to fondle and suckle the
  motherless child.          «>
     Koruna Kumar*s (Kandukuri Anantam) Akali mantalu (the burn¬
 ing flames of hunger) portrays human character from all angles.
 It starts with illustrating the miserly hard-hearted nature of
 Sarojini, a house-wife, and ends with revealing the charitable
 disposition and the nobility of heart which Sarojini really
 possessed.

his style was not vitiated by any foreign expiessions.
    Palagummi Padmaraju (1915) has been hailed as one of the
 best story writers ever sinec he won the second prize in the World

   Telangana, wrote humorous stories with the caption of MaywSh
   (in our house).
      Mudda Visvanatham (1909) is another short story writer worth
   mentioning. He has writen many short stories which first
   appeared in Telugu journals like the Bharatu He has a facile
  pen. Among his stories, AUnajyotif Jarnnahhumif Tultka, Siibho*
  de^amUf Chhaya are the best. Some of them are rich In pathos.
     Avasarala Surya Rao (1923) has published a volume of shmt

4md its problems, with a critical yet sympathetic eye. His best
story is Memu Mugguram (we three).
   Several thousands of short stories have appeared in the Telugu
Journals and they Rre read with interest, particularly by women
as well as by boys and girls. I have read many of them. I cannot
say that, except a few of them, they deserve a place in literature.
But I am glad to ijote that short story writing is progressing both
in quality and quantity; and I am quite confident that in the
course of a few years this art reaches perfection in the hands of
many writers.

                      (c) Sketches and Features

   Sketches in the sense of rough outlines, as of a literary work or
of a drama or playlet forming part of Vaudeville programme, are
prepared for the Radio and Film pictures. Since there is no
scope for elaborate accounts, short sketches that can be broadcast
in ten to fifteen minutes are required for the Radio programmes
and they relate to several subjects of literary interest, such as
Ffene Srinatkuda-n-aite (If I were Srinatha the great poet), Raja-
iaranginij Telugu Proverbs, Janapada Geyas, etc., and features such
as the court of R<ya Raja J^arendra, the court poets of Sri Krishna
devaraya, etc. The titles and scripts of Film stories are also
sketches and *they are written by well-known poets and story
writers like Tapi Dharma Rao, Gopichand, Sri Sri, Atreya and
Samudralas (father and spn).
   Gurazada Appa Rao’s lengthy notes on cultural topics, outlines
of his proposed dramas, and letters are now published and they

the monthly Telugu journal, Andhra Mahila month after month
humorous sketches of the Domestic and Social life of men and
women and as Manalo nuUa (between ourselves). They were
published in a book form in 1958 with my introduction.

                  (d) Essays and Literary Criticism               «

   Essay writing, like some other branches of modem Telugu
literature, is the outcome of our acquaintance with essays in
English literature. The term essay is very elastic, even in Englhh
and iyasamu is t^ Telugu word used tp- mfihn Essay. There have
JAW mBiAs: pmon                                                     23S
  Appeared hundreds of essays in Telugu Journals bttt very few
 ■of them have been published in book-form mainly because they
  command no good sale in the country except wh«a they are
 prescribed as text-books ft^r the University or school final examina**
  tions.
     The first known Essayist is Samineni Muddu Narasimha Naidu
 '^(District MunsifiT at Rs^ahmundri) who published in 1862 a
 collection of his essays uhder the title of Hita Suehini, They relate
 to Education, Medicine, Magic, Marriage, Psychology, the
  language of the beasts, and the myl;h of making gold. The
 language used was the spoken dialect of the cultured classes.
  The essays exhibit the author*s varied knowledge, clear thought
 and felicity of expression. The essay on marriage is the longest.
 Pram^amu is the word he used for essay.
     The next essayist is Kandukuri Viresalingam whose essays on
  many different topics have been published in one of the ten volumes
 of his works. Many of his essays relate to the social and ethical
  problems of the day. In point of technique, his essays are terse
  and lucid and are presented in paragraphs, to denote.the progress
  of the thought. The terms Vyasamu and Upmyasamu are used by
 liim to mean essay. He used a very simple style so that the
■ordinary reader can understand his essays.
     Duggirala Venkata Surya Prakasa Rao published his essays on
 aocial and religious subjects first in the Telugu journals of those
 days, Vivekavardhani and Hindujana Samskarintj and later in book-
 form. His last essay is is there salvation for India?          “ Social
 reform association and its objects ” by K. R. K. Krishna Rao is
  a lenghty essay of 35 pages in simple Telugu intended to convince
  the people that it was quite necessary to effect social reform.

 Chandra Rao read his essay on Manu Vasu Prakasika and this led
 to a controversy. Kasibhatla Brahmayya Sastri wrote many
 essays, some of which were meant to attack Viresalirgam regarding
 his Rajasikhara Charitra or his social reform activities. In 189d
 he wrote Bhaskarodantam.
    During 1912-1920 many essays appeared for and against the
 Modern Telugu movement. Gidugu Venkata Ramamurti’s collected
 essays were published in book form by the Katya Sakitya Parishad

about his travels to the North as far as Badarinath.
   Bulusu Venkataramanayya published tw'o books (1) Ma Dakshina
desa Tatra and (2) Ma Uttara desa Tatra in 1958. They relate to
the travels made to the south as far as Rame«varam and to the
north as far as Delhi. The author travelled wuth his colleagues
and students of Kellctt High School, Triplicane, Madras. The
books arc written in dignified spoken dialect. His descriptions
of the journey, and of places and scenes of interest are vivid.

                 (f) Fine Arts—Painting and Sculpture

   Aldiough the Telugu country is very rich in temples, Buddhist
Chatty as i caves etc., and the scope for iconographic studies is very
wide, Telugu literature relating to them is scanty. The few
students interested in Indian Antiquities have written articles in
English, for the obvious reason that they could 1 c appreciated by
the western scholars and by Indian scholars knowing English,
tt is only during the last thirty or forty years that they have thought
of writing articles on this subject in Telugu. Talisetti Rama Rao,
240                                HISTORY OP TELVGU LlTERATCJltft

 who evinced interest in drawing while yet he was a student ofthe-
 lower forms at Jeyapore developed his artistic slcill. His cartoons^
 were published in the Telugu jouinals. He wrote one or two
 small books on drawing and painting, but more important than '
 this was his translation of Percy Brown’s Bharatiya Chitrakala^
 (Indian Art of Painting). Mutnuri Krishna Rao published in
his Krishna Patrika a series of articles on Indian Painting and
 Pictorial Art. In the Telugu journal, Kala which P. V. Raja-
 mannar edited thirty five years ago, Duvvuri Rami Reddi published
 many articles on this sul^jcct. Adivi Bapiraju, who was himself
 an aitist, travelled all over the Telugu country and delivered
veiy illuminating lectures on Indian art. Suryadevara Sanjiva
 Dev is a good critic of fine arts, and he has written several critical
articles on the subject. Bhavaraju Krishna Rao’s articles on the
 temples at Mukhalingam (built in the 8th century A.D.) were
published in the Telugu journal Bharati. Mallampalli Soma-
sekhaia Sarma has written some articles on the sculpture of the
Telugu country. Gadiyaram Ramakrishna Sarma wrote inte¬
resting articles on the temples of Alampur (near Kurnool).
   A brilliant book on Sculpture is Silpadarsanamu by Konduru
Viraraghavacharyulu, It was published in 1946; but some portions
had been previously published in some Telugu journals such as
/indhra Prabha^ Andhri and Arunodaya, It consists of eleven chapters
of which Silpa tatvaniy Rupa silpaniy Devalaya silpam are the most
important. The author devoted seveial years to the study and
the collection of the material. He says that he has prepared his-
list of 364 books from a Maharashtra ^rnntha and from Studies in
Indian History bv Dr. Narendranath Law. Though this book
is not connected directly with sculpture in the Telugu country,,
it helps the Telugu readci to undci stand the subject.
   Sripada Gopala Krishnamurti wrote a book on Andhra Silpa
Parichayamu which won the State Awaid in 1956.
   Dr. G, SatyanarayanaChowdariofMadrashas published a very
vtluable little book on Indian Art with reproductions of important
paintings and pieces of sculpture. He is himself a painter of note..

                (g) Books Relating to Histoty and Politics

    It is inevitable that a comprehensive history of a country or of
 an important region of it should be written in the language of the
 ptsople. But as English wa« the medium of instruction even in
 the lower forms of high schools, till some years ago, as it still is in
 the college classes, the need for writing history books in Telugu
 was not felt. There were, even in Sanskrit, fragmentary history
 books such as Kalhana’s Rajatarangini and Bana’s Harsha Charitra.
 A connected account of any period of Indian History came to be
 written only as the result of the researches carried on in the first
 instance by Orientalists among English scholars. While there
 were considerable sources of history relating to the Mohammedan
 and British periods, the sources for the early and medieval Hindu
 Period were scattered and neglected. A study of epigraphy was
 the greatest need. So far as the Telugu country is concerned
 the first scholars of epigraphy were Jayanti Ramayya, Gidugu
 Ramamurti and Gurazada Appa Rao. Of these, Ramamurti
 wrote Antiquities of Mukhalingam in which he established that
 Mukhalingam was the capital of ancient Madhya Kalinga, that
 Nagarikatakam near it was its cantonment, and that Kalinga-
 patnam was its sea-port. Thirty years later, his son Sitapati
 (the present writer) proved that the region was originally the
 country of the Savaras, and that, in about 720 A.D., it was con¬
 quered by Kamamava of the Eastern Ganga dynasty who
 overthrew the Savara King, Sabaraditya, as mentioned in the
 copper plates of Anasita Varma Ghodaganga. Later on, there
 arose many scholars in the field, of whom Mallampalli Soma-
sekhara Sarma has been the foremost. In the meanw'hile, scholars
like Ghilakamarti and K. V. Krishna Rao rendered into Telugu
Raj^thanakatkavah and Rajatarangini and they may be regarded
as the first books on history in Telugu literature. The Andhra
Historical Research Society at Rajahmundry has given considerable
impetus to research work. Some years prior to this, the South
Indian Research Journal (English) was started at Madras through
the endeavours of Tekumalla Raja Gopala Rao who wrote some
articles also in Telugu. Regular history books in Telugu were
written when Komurazu lAkshmana Rao and his friends organised
the Vijnma Chandrika Graatka Mandali. Lakshmana Rao was a
great ^cholar^ well versed in Telugu, English, Sanskrit, Marathi^
     16
224                                   HISTORY OF TSLUOU UTERATURI

 Bengali, Tamil and Kannada. He was interested in the progress
 of Telugu literature, and of epigraphy and historical research.
 He encouraged the writing of historical novels and r(^lar histories.
 The most important outcome of this institution and of the
 encouragement given by Lakshmana Rao was Chilukuri Vii^-
 bhadra Rao’s Andkrula Charitra, This may be regarded as the
 first authoritative historical work in Telugu. It was not a mere
 narration of events. With extensive quotations from Telugu
 literature of the Prabandha period, he wrote his book in an
 attractive style, worthy df being recognised as standard Telugu
 prose. He also wrote Jima Karnataka Scmrajyamu^ TimmarusUf
  TUckanOy SrineUhuduy Sivajiy and Nayakuralu (of Palnati Viracharitra),
    Gadicharla Harisarvothama Rao who was closely associated
with Lakshmana Rao, wrote Vismrita Rafakavi (A neglected
emperor>poet: Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagar) and Abraham
Lincoln. With the object of publishing the history of the world
in Telugu he commenced to write the history of Greece and Rome,
but had to give up the later portions as he had to shoulder the
responsibility of editing Andhra Patrika at Madras.
    Lakshmana Rao himself wrote the history of the Hindu and
Mohammedan periods of Indian History, in a lucid, attractive
style.
    Anodier scholar who was associated with Lakshmana Rao was
Ayyadevara Kaleswara Rao. He wrote Amerika Samyukta
Rashtreunulu and French Svatantrya Vijayam and some years later,
 Turushka Samrajyam, His selection of these subjects was due to
his nationalistic spirit and his participation in the freedom struggle
of India.
    Velum Satyanarayana wrote Fahien’s travels in India and the
Bauddkamahcyugam.
    Inspired by Lakshmana Rao and Chilukuri Virabhadra Rao,
Mallampalli Somasekhara Samoa wrote in Telugu several books
relating to the history of the Andhras. His Andhra Vinduy AmarawaU
Stupam and Charitraka Vyasatmlu are of great value.
    Nelaturi Venkata Ramanayya specialised in the history of
Vigayanagar Empire and is regarded as an authority on this

    the initiative of the talented founders, the late Bhavaraju Venkata
    Krishna Rao and G. Virabhadra Rao, The Society’s periodical
    publications, Raja Raja Sap^hikay Kalinga Stmehikay Reddiyuga Sandnka
    and Kakatiya Samhika contain valuable articles.
       Among other scholars who wrote books or articles based on
    their research, the most important are Jayanti Ramayya, Bhavaraju
    Venkata Krishna Rao, Chilukuri Narayana Rao, Maremanda
    Rama Rao, Vaddadi Appa Rao, Puttaparti Srinivasacharyulu,
    Vangolu Venkata Rangayya, Prayaga Seshadri Sastri, Gidugu
    Venkata Sitapati and Mamidipudi Vedkata Rangayya.
       Digavalli Venkata Siva Rao is a good scholar and veteran
    prose writer. His Afnka Jatiya udyamamu traces the history of
    Africa from the commencement of the colonization by the white
    races up to the modern times, including the activities of
    Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa. Poorva Rangamulu deals with
    incidents in the freedom struggle prior to 1857. He has also
    written a valuable history of the British period in India.
       Andra Seshagiri Rao’s Rmaptatapasimha is worth mentioning
   on account of its good style and attractive descriptions of incidents.
       Madapati Hanumanta Rao's Hindvaiyulu~Vari Rajyangarmlu is a
    good contribution to Ancient History of India and political
    institutions.
       Adirazu Virabhadra Rao’s inscriptions of Telangana and
    ancient cities of Andhra Desa are valuable contributions to
    Epigraphy and History. The author has been a devoted student
   of these subjects. His Telugu prose is simple, idiomatic and
   Signified.
       Kota Sundara Rama Sarnia’s Sri Harsha Rajyasri and Tatta
   Ranga Ramanujacharya’s Harsha Charitray a translation of Sana’s
   work deserve mention.
       Tallapragada Suryanarayana Rao translated Romesh Dutt’s
   “ Economic History of British India ” and his novel “ The slave
   ^irl of Agra        He also contributed a scholarly introduction to
   a new edition of Surana’s Frabhmati Pradyumnam.
       Manikonda Satyanarayana Sastri has translated in beautijful
             prose the monumental work of Major Basu, “ Rise of the
V <ihristum Power in India ’’and Tilak’s “ Arctic Home ”, Kodali
   Awjangyyln’* translation of Dr. Pattabhi Sitaramayya’s “ Htory

                        (h) Scientific Works

   There were Telugu books on some scientific subjects but they
 were in verse and they related to medicine (Ayurveda), Gajar
Sastra, Asvasastra, etc. After contact with Western culture, Telugu
scholars began to write books in prose on scientific subjects..
It is very interesting to note the existence of a Telugu book in
prose so early as 1836 on " Cooking ” written by a lady, Sarasvati
Bai. It was translated into English by Kavali Venkata Ramasvami.
   It is again Viresalingam Pantulu that began the publication
of scientific works in Telugu prose. He wrote an elaborate book
on Human Physiology. He followed Huxley’s “ Physiology
but it was not quite a translation. He consulted several other
books in English on the subject. He also consulted Susruta,
Ashtanga hridaya etc., in Sanskrit, but he said that they helped
him only in the matter of suggesting appropriate technical
expressions. The book is illustrated and a list of 300 technical
terms is appended. Later on, in 1894, he wrote also “ Natural
history of Mammalia ” with more than 60 illustrations. N. Nara-
simham wrote Bhautika Sastramu in the early years of this century*
Achanta Venkataraya Sankhyayana Sarma’s Rahatya darpananr
is an interesting book on the secrets of Science, particularly in
Botany and Horticulture.
   The VtjnanaChan'lrlkaGrantkaMandalicnco\l^^LgedTel\l^\l scholars-
to write books on scientific subjects also.   Vemuri Visvanatha
Sarma wrote Rasayana Sastramu (Chemistry). Mantipragada
Sambasiva Rao wrote Padartha Vijnana Sastram (Physics). C. Rama*
linga Reddi wrote Artha Sastramu (Political Economy) and later
on Goteti Jogirazu wrote several books on botany and agriculture.
   Achanta Lakshmipati -wrote Jiva Sastram (Biology) and jfantir
Sastram (Zoology) for the Mandali and later, books on Ayurveda^
The Andhra University published a book on Zoology written by^
R. V. Seshayya. D. V. Subba Reddi wrote several short books on
Arogya Setstra (Hygiene and Health). Gullapalli Narayanamurti
wrote Gramarogya rakshana for which he received the State award
in 1949. N. M. Venugopal Naidu published Ramyaharmycmm (The
beautiful house I live in) meaning human physiology, which also
received the State Award in 1950. G. Venkatesvara Sarma
wrote Vanaushadha Vijnanamu which recei^d the State Award in
 1951. Chillaiige Srinivasa Rao published his Mgkya Aushtdhet
Gum Dipika (Materia Medica} in Telugu.
ifEW trends: prose                                                 245
     In the third decade, two scholars, Chinta Dikshitulu and
  Paranandi Jagannatha Svamy wrote two separate books on
 JParimmavadam (The theory of Evolution) both of whom received
  the Madras University Prize. Kalipatnapu Kondayya translated
  “ The Universe Around us ” of Sir James Jeans and wrote it in
  spoken dialect. S. Visvanatnam wrote Adhunika Vtjnana Sastramu
  which was awarded a prize by the Raja of Vanaparti. ^ This book
  gives the readers an idea of the various branches of science in
 simple and lucid language.
     In recent years some scholars have written short books on Atomic
 sciences also. Vissa Appa Rao wrote a'small book on Paramanu-
  sakti. His book on Akasam for children has won the Government
 award. A few authors have been writing for the people, popular
  science books of whom the most prominent are Vasantarao
  Venkata Rao, Vemarazu Bhanumurti and Hari Adi Seshu. Of
  these Vasantarao Venkata Rao attempts to make his writings
 attractive by writing them as gey as.
     There are also books on other scientific subjects. Gullapalli
 Narayanamurti wrote a book on Manas-Sastramu (Psychology)
 which also received the State Award in 1950. Hari Adiseshu
 wrote Vidyut-sakti: upayogamulu (Electricity and its uses) for which
 he received the State prize in 1951. K. Seshagiri Rao wrote
 Khagola Sastramu (Astronomy) and won the State Prize in 1953.
 S. L. Narasimha Rao wrote Bhugarbha Sastramu (Geology).
 M. Virabhadra Rao wrote Andhra Desamandu jala-vidyut-pranalikala
 vistrtiki gala avakasamulu (Hydro electric projects in Andhra desa)
 which won the State prize in 1957. Koduri Lilavati Devi and
 G. Balatripurasundari wrote books on Grihanirvahana Sastramu
 (domestic economy) both of which received the State Awards in
 1953. S. L. Narasimha Rao wrote Vyakti sampadita gunamulu
 taratarala tatalanati lakshnamula ? (Are the acquired qualities of the
 individual hereditary?) B. Narasimham wrote Aramakedpataruvu
 (The scientific aspect of gardens) which won him the state prize
in 1956.
    Boyanapalli Padmarazu wrote * Sahakarartkika Vijnanamu (Co¬
operative economics) which won the state prize in 1951. AnAhrof
bkpudayamu—Iruoadiyava SatabHamulo (Social progress in the 20th
■century) won the State Award in 1954.
    Two ^books on KtUira ParisrameUu—Vati prqyojanamtdu (Cottage
industries) were written by M. SarojiniDcvi and K, Satyanarayana
Varma, both of whom won the State Award in 1956.
246                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

   In recent years an attempt has been made to give the status of
modem science to the ancient Ayurveda and accordingly A, Subba
Rao wrote Ayurvedamui Adhunika Sastriya Paddhatini dani vikasamu
(The development of Ayurveda on modem scientific lines), and
this book received the State Award in 1957.
   Music and Dance have also received the attention of modem
writers. Vinjamuri Varaha Narasimhacharyulu’s Karnataka
Sangita parhumamu and D. V. A. Acharya’s Chitrajagaii (Cinema)
received the State Awards in 1952. Nataraja Ramakrishna*s
Dakshinatyula Natyakala Qiaritra which received the State Award
in 1954 is a profusely illustrated book. Mikkilineni Radhakrishna
Murti’s Nalaka kala received the State Award in 1955. Balantrapu
Rajanikanta Rao’s Andhra Vaggeyakara Charitramu received the
State Award in 1956.
   Vedala Timvengalacharya’s Chaturmata tatvamu (The philosophy
of Sankara, Ramanuja, Madhva and Vallabhacharya) won the*
State Award in 1954. G. S. Sarma wrote under social science
Prajatantra rajya bharamu—Dani acharana and this received the State
Award in 1957.
   Thus the Telugu Bhasha Samiti has encouraged ScientiHc
literature and the State Awards to the best books on the subjects
have been distributed by the Samiti.
   Bulusu Venkatesvarulu’s Bharatiya Tatlva Sastramu is a translation
of Dr.’S. Radhakrishnan’s Indian Philosophy which received the
Award of the Sahitya Akademi in 1956.

                   (i) Biography and Autobiography

   This branch of literature was very rare either in Sanskrit or in
Telugu. Harsha Charitra and Vikramankadeva Charitra were not
exact biographies. They were eulogistic in character because
they were composed by court poets.
   In Telugu literature such biographies were, unlike in Sanskrit^
Composed in verse in the prabandha style—Krishnarnya Vije^arnhy
KumaraDhuijatiand/?<^^Ra^Aa^^tt</a^am by Vijayaraghava Nayak>
   Biography as a special branch of literature attracted the Telugu
writers after the contact with English literature. Biographies are
of two kinds — Biographies of the heroes of the past and biographies
of contemporaries; and the Earliest biographies were transiatk»i»
from English. The first biography tr^lated into Telugu was
NSW trends: prose                                                2^7
that of John Bunyan in 1856. Viresalingam Fantulu wrote three
biographies — of Jesus, Shelley and Queen Victoria. In 1892
the S.P.C.K. Press published pictutes and stories of noble womcp.
such as Lady Jane Grey, Florence Nightingale, and Padmini, the
Qjiieen of Ghittoor, Ahalya Bai, Pandita Rama Bai, etc. In 1897
the life of Ghaitanya was published. The biographies of Raja
Rammohan Roy were also published in the same series. In
1884 A. StmdaraRamayya published the “Lives of Great Men and
Women ” including Justice Muthusvami Ayyar, Dadabhai Naoroji,
Ahalya Bai, etc.. But all these books, though valuable, had little
literary merit.
   Guruzada Sri Ramamurti’s Kavt Jtvitemulu was written in a
dignified style on the model of Johnson’s Lives of English Poets. His
other biographies were of Bendapudt Annama mantri, Timmarusu,
Bhaskara mantri and Suami Vidyaranya. All these biographies were
published in the last years of the 19th century.
   In 1900 Rayasam Venkata Sivudu published a book on the
lives of some great women, and later, of Socrates. Bhandaru
Achamamba’s biographical work, Abalor-satchantrorratrumala was
published in 1901. About the same time appeared Vavilala
Venkata Sivavadhani’s detailed biography of Vidyaranya Svami.
K. V. Lakshmana Rao’s biography oiSivaji is a book of outstanding
merit. Vedam Venkataraya Sastn’s biography was written by
his grandson bearing the same name in 1950. The Praja Sakti
Press published in 1946 a short biography of Gidugu Ramamurti
written by his son Sitapati. Gorrepati Venkata Subbayya’s
biography of Sarojini Dm received the State Award in 1950.
Venkata Subbayya has also written the biography of Arharya
Ranga. Ghirantanananda Svami’s Sn Ramaknshna Paramahamsa
Jivita CharUra is an inspiring account which received the Sahitya
Akademi Award in 1958.
   Kona Venkataraya Sarma the heart and soul of the Andhra
Sarasvata Maha Parishad in Andhra has written biographical
sketches of Andhra Sachivottamulu (Ministers) and DandaneUhubi
(Commanders).
   The Andhra Pradarsini published by the Visalandhra Prachura*
nalaya has presented under Andhra Mahapurushulu l^ghthy bic^apra-
{laical sketches of (1) Naoe^ga Mrmata Kandukuri Viresalingam
(1848-1919); (2) Sfavt^ga Mekakrm Gurazada Appa Rao (ld61‘>
1915);     (3) katya Vi^amsasamidu Gidugu Ramamurti (1862^

 (1877-1923); (5) Jflftj?ot^flmaPwAflA:«rf«Kasinathun»NagcsvaraRao
 (1867-1938); and (6) Andhra Pitamaha Madapati Hanumanta
 Rao (1885)
    Sringarakavi Sarvaraya kavi (1864-1939) a prolific writer wrote
 Sivaji’s life in a very good style. Harisarvothama Rao’s biography
 of Abraham Lincoln is also a commendable biography. Attili
 Suryanarayana’s biography of Mahakavi Ravindra is an interesting
 and inspiring book.
    Among the biographies of contemporary great men we have
 Viresalingam’s biography of his friend and collaborator Basavarazu
 Gavarrazu. During the life time of Viresalingam, his biography
 was written by Toleti Venkata Subba Rao in 1894. In its preface
 Subba Rao says “It is with great diffidence that I have under¬
 taken this work. I have taken upon myself the honour of writing
 a critical biography of the well known social reformer, prose-
 writer and poet Rao Bahadur K. Viresalingam Pantulu”. Pundla
 Ramakrishnayya wrote the biography of Mandapaka Parvatis-
 vara Sastri. Kamaraju Hanumantha Rao wrote an admirable
 biography of the late Desiraju PfdaBapa>ya, an idealist and devout
Brahmo.
    In recent years, Vavilla Venkatesvara Sastri published many
biographies in Telugu of the great nationalists such as Gokhale,
Tilak, Naoroji, Ranade, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Viveka-
 nanda, Annie Peasant, Aurobindo, etc. Nidadavolu Venkata
Rao wrote a biography of Chinnaya Suri.
    Autobiography is altogether a new feature in Telugu literature.
Viresalingam Pantulu is again the first to write an autobiography.
His Sviya Charitra was published in 1910 and it was revised and
published by him in 1917.
   Chinnaya Suri wrote his Svachariiram a few years before his death.
Chellapilla Venkata Sastri wrote his autobiography wider the
title of jatakaefuaya. Rayasam Venkata Sivudu and Panuganti
Narasimha Rao also wrote their autobiographies. Ghilakamarti
Lakshminarasimham’s autobiography is a voluminous book, with
reflections on contemporary events and a commentary of his times*
Andhra Kesari Prakasam’s autobiography, though short, is charming
and inspiring. K. N. Kesari’s Ma Chirmanati Muechatalu (events of
my early life) is very interesting because he rose from a humble
condition to a very high status through hts peraevering effenrts.
 NEW TRENPS: PROSE                                              249

The autobiographies of Gandhi and Nehru have been translated
 into Telugu by Veluri Sivarama Sastri and Mudiganti Jagganna
 Sastri.
    The autobiography of Ayyadcvara Kalesvara Rao known as
 Na Jivitakatha—Naoyandhramu (my life story—New Andhra) was
 published in 1959. The social, political and cultural history of
 the Andhras as well as the part played by Kalesvara Rao in it has
 been vividly described in simple Telugu.
    The autobiography of Dasari Lakshmanaswamy of Pithapuram
 published in 1956 is a remarkable autobiography. The author
 is not widely known, nor is he a great* personality. Very little
space is allotted to his own life and achievements and a major
part of his work refers to the varied activities of the Maharaja of
 Pithapuram in whose service he had been engaged since his earliest
 years. He stopped his studies at school while he was in form I
 but he could sing very well and his interest in music, songs and
 Harikathas led him to study Telugu literature. He became a poet
•of some merit, through his own efforts. His autobiography
presents to us some aspects of the social and cultural history of the
Telugus during fifty years (1900-1950). It is clear from this that
biographies of even less-known arc important.

           (j) Letters and Writings of Epistolary Character

    This branch of literature also is very meagre. There were no
doubt various kinds of letters in the 19th century. The Rajahs
of Venkatagiri and Bobbili were requesting Pandits in different
 places to write to them their opinions about certain controversial
social problems like marriage, caste and daya vibhagam (division of
 property) and the letters written by the Pandits were like essays.
 But unfortunately they have never been published. The Amudnta^
granJtha Chintamani edited by Pundla Ramakrishnayya at Nellore
published letters from some Pandits of his time. They afford
interesting reading but these have not been published in book
form.
   Mantripragada Bhujanga Rao, editor of Manjuvaniy Eluru, with
his refinement and scholarship published in Telugu a book of
MoheUekhaveUi (Love letters) in 1904. He was enthused to do so
when he read such books in English, published in England and in
India. Kamala's Letters by Rentala Venkata Subba Rao in English
250                                HISTORY OF TBLUOU LfTERATURE

was then very popular in India and had a good sale in England
also. Bhujanga Rao’s book consists of two parts. The first
part contains 50 letters relating to the heroes and heroines of the-
Prabandhas and Puranas, as between Nala and Damayanti,
Krishna and Satyabhama, Krishna and Radha, Dushyanta and
Sakuntala, and Rati and Manmatlia. The second part contains
100 letters relating to the present day loves of Sviyay Parakiya and
Samanya. They are written in chaste language and with refinement
and propriety in thought and expression.
   There appeared £ilso translations into Telugu of books like Lord
Chesterfield’s letters to his son by Ghitravarapu Venkata Nara-^
simha Rao in 1919.        Maganti Annapurna Devi translated inta
Telugu the letters of Aurobindo to his wife. Her own letters to
her husband, M. Bapinidu while he was studying in America, wore
published after her premature death.       They reveal great tender¬
ness and a lively interest in the welfare of the Motherland.
   A short story, Badhyata (Responsibility) by Pantula Srirama
Sastri which was written exclusively in the form of letters was
already mentioned under Short story.
   But this branch of literature has yet to be developed.

        (k) Lexicons: Books of Knowledge and Enryclopaedias

(i) Lexicons in Telugu'.
   Lexicons in Telugu as in Sanskrit, were in verse until 1816 or
1818, when the idea of arranging words in the alphabetical order
dawned on the Telugu lexicographers. In Sanskrit Lexicons^
the words were arranged according to topics or subjects, and in
each group the alphabetical order was followed. But in Telugu
the lexicogpraphers did not follow such an order. In arranging
separately the words containing the ordinary trilled “ r ” and
those containing the retrofiex R ”, Appakavi followed the alpha¬
betical order in the case of the letters preceding the two “ r *’ and
   R ”. Kuchimanchi Timma Kavi also followed the same method
in the case of these words.

  The following are the Telugu lexicons in verse;—(1619-1637)

   In 1816, Mamidi Venkatarya, the first Telugu Lexicographer
prepared the Andhra Diptha^ a Lexicon (Tel-Tel) of the modem
type, arranging the words in the alphabetical order, but it was
published only in 1848.
   In 1818 William Brown published a short Telugu-English
Lexicon under the title of, “ A vocabulary of Gentoo and English,
composed of words of current use and illustrated by examples,
applicable to the familiar speech and writings of the Middle orders
and more elevated Ranks of the Modem Gentoo people — by a
Senior Merchant of the Madras Establishment, Many years
Resident in the Northern Circars 1818 — William Brown
   As this was published thirty years prior to the publication of thcr
Andhra Dtptka, this came to be mentioned as the first Lexicon of the
modem type. Moreover, this is really the first of the Lexicons
with meanings in English opposite to the Telugu words arranged
in the alphabetical order. The lexicons which followed the
method of Mamidi Venkatarya of giving the meanings etc., in
Telugu are Ghunduri Ranganayakulu Chetty’s Andhra Dipika in
1859 and, almost about the same time, Sabdaratnakaram by Bahujana-
palli Sitaramcharyulu; and the subsequent lexicons that followed
the method adopted by William Brown were Campbell’s and
C. P. Brown’s Telugu-English and English-Telugu Lexicons.
   William Brown’s Lexicon was reprinted in 1953 by Kottapalll
Subba Ramayya of The Cultural Books Ltd., Madras, with a
lengthy introductory essay by G.       Sitapati in which he traced
the evolution of lexicons in Sanskrit and Telugu. C. P. Brown^i
Telugu-English as well as English-Telugu Lexicons are now out
of stock and out of print. His Telugu-English is a very valuabb
dictionary because it contains the idiomatic use of words which is
not so exhaustively presented in any other lexicon present or past*
It, therefore, deserves to be reprinted^

     The Other lexicons in the country which followed Sabdaratnakaram
  are: (1) Andhra Pada Parijatam by the joint authors—Ogirala
 Jagannatha Kavi and Guruzada Ramamurti in 1888 (2) Sabdartha
  Chandrika by Mahankali Subbaraya Kavi—a concise dictionary for
  the use of students (1906)       (3) P. Sankaranarayana’s Telugu-
  English and English-Telugu Dictionaries (1903) (4) Lakshmi-
  narayaniyam by Kotra Lakshminarayana Sastri (1914) — a
  dictionary of “ pure ” Telugu words- (5) Andhra Vachaspatyam in
  four volumes by Kotra Syamala Kama Sastri, son of Lakshmi¬
  narayana Sastri (1940). (6) Suryarayandhra Mghantuvu in seven
  volumes by Pandits appointed by the Maharaja of Pithapuram
  (1916-1959). (7) Vavilla Mghantuvu (incomplete—^vols. 1-3) by
 Eripada Subrahmanya Sastri and Bulusu Venkateswarlu (1938-
  1955). Digavalli Venkata Siva Rao has published in recent
  years a dictionary of English-Telugu Technical and Scientific
  terms.
    There are also prova-bs arranged according to the alphabetical
 •order of the first woids by Carr (1869) and by Nandirazu Chalapati
  Rao (1940). It is said that Chilukuri Narayana Rao collected
 several thousand proverbs but they have not been published.
 The Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi has recently published
 a book of proverbs under the editorship of Visvanatha Satya-
 narayana with a lengthy and scholarly introduction by S. Raghava-
 chari (1959). The proverbs are arranged according to the
 alphabetical order of the first words.
    A dictionary of idiomatic expressions under the title of Telugu
Jatiyarmdu was published by Nalam Krishna Rao in 1940. The
 Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi has also undertaken to publish
 this more extensively and the first volume was published under the
 editorship of Narla Venkateswara Rao in 1959. These idioms
 (words and phrases) arc also arranged according to the alphabetical
order.

(ii) Books of Knowledge
   Yenamandra Venkata Ramayya’s Parana Mama Chandrika was
published in 1879. The topics were arranged according to the
alphabetical order and they related to sages and greatmen of the
Epic and Puranic ages. A more exhaustive work of the same kind
was subsequently published by Vemuri Srinivasa Rao in 1938,
                                                                   OCi

  (ili) En^topaedias
     Encyclopaedia Britannica and other Encyclopaedias in English
  inspired the Andhra scholars to produce similar works in Telugu.
  The first enterprise in this field was undertaken by Mahamaho.
 Padhyaya Paravastu Venkata Rangacharyulu in the last years ol
  the 19th century. He worked all alone for about forty years, and
 finished topics under words commencing with “ a ” and ** aa **,
 The second endeavour was made by K. V. Lakshmana Rao with
  the assitance of Mallampalli Somasekhara Sarma and Rayaprolu
  Subba Rao. But this also became abortive on account of the
 death of Lakshmana Rao in 1923 and the work so far done covered
 only the words beginning with “ a ” and “ aa ”.
     The difference between these two abortive works is in the out¬
 look and the conception of the authors. While the former desired
 to convey the Oriental learning and the ancient culture of India,
 the latter desired to convey the Universal knowledge of all countries
 and cultures. Ten years later K. Nagesvara Rao (of Andhra
 Pairika) desired to revive it. He got the work done by Lakshmana
 Rao revised afresh but his work also became abortive. He published
 only the two revised volumes covering the first two letters of the
 alphabet and the work was given up on account of his death
 in 1938.
     Maganti Bapinidu published in 1942 a modest encyclopaedia
 known as Andhra Sarvasvamu imdcr the joint editorship of Moturi
 Satyanarayana and G. V. Sitapati. But this was limited to
 Andhra and dealt only with the social, religious, economic, linguistic
 and cultural activities of the Andhras. The matter was presented
not in the alphabetical order but according to subjects.
    Five years later in 1947, the Telugu Bhasha Samiti was formed in
Madras with B. Gopala Reddi as the President and M. Satya¬
narayana as the Joint Secretary, and through their efforts the
Samiti secured financial aid from the composite State of Madras.
In 1948 it contemplated the compilation of a comprehensiver
Encyclopaedia in Telugu in twelve volumes. The work started
with G. V. Sitapati as the Chief Compiler and Editor. It docs'
not favour the alphabetical method adopted by Encyclopaedia
Britannica or other Encyclopaedias in the field. It follows the
subjcctwise method. The first volume relating to history and
politics was published in 1954 and, a few months later the second
volume relating to physics and chemistry was published.          The*
1254                                  HISTORY OF TELUGU LITERATURE

two volumes relating to the Telugu Culture — language, literal
tore, arts, geography and history, etc. was published in 1959.
The other volumes are in varying stages of progress.^
   In 1953 scholars at Hyderabad contemplated the production
of a shorter Encyclopaedia in Telugu in six voliunes adopting the
alphabetical order. The first volume was published in 1958. It
 covers matter under the first two letters of alphabet. The second
volume has also been published.
   It is interesting to note that B. Gopala Reddi is the President
and Moturi SatyanarayansP a member of the Executive Committee
of this Encyclopaedia also.
   An Encyclopaedia for young readers known as Bala Vtjnana
Sarvasvamu has been making slow but steady progress through the
oiforts of Md. Khassim Khan.
   Kandukuri Devi Vara Prasada Rao published during 1940-5
hve volumes of an Encyclopaedia devoted to the Oriental culture
of India.

               (1) History of Telusy, Poets and Literature

    Vircsalingam Pantulu is again the first in the writing of History
 of Telugu Literature but what he actually wrote was Andhra Kax}ula
 ChariXra (The lives of Telugu Poets) arranged in chronological
 order. He followed the method indicated in Johnson’s “ Lives of
  English Poets ”. About the same time Guruzada Sriramamurti
  wrote his Lives of Telugu Poets under the title of Kavi Jivitamulu.
  But he did not arrange them according to the chronological order.
 He classified them under headings such as Parana Kaoulu, Prabandha
  Kavuluy etc. and he selected only the leading poets.
    Subsequently scholars wrote articles about poets and books, not
  mentioned by Viresalingam or Guruzada Sriramamurti. Dmmg
 the last years of his life (1915-1919), Viresalingam commenced to
 revise his “ Lives of Telugu Poets ” in the light of the suggestions
 received from various scholars, either through their articles to
 journals or their letters, or as a result of his own researches. He
 could publish his revised and enlarged first volume upto the 15th
 century A.D. He could not complete the work on account of
his death in 1919.
   After 1919 many more boc^ of the previous centuries came to
IJg^t. The Andhra University sent scholars to Tai^ore to secure
  * Ten volumes since published

manuscripts^ not previously published. Plenty of books of the
Southern School of Telugu literature thus came to light. Descrip¬
tive Catalogues of Telugu manuscripts in the Tanjore Maharaja
Seribji Sarasvati Mahal 'jLibrary were published by the Andhra
University. Pingali Lakshmikantam sponsored the entire prqject,
supervised it, and gave it a proper direction. He published the
Dvipada BhareUam in the first instance with an introduction.
   The following books or lengthy articles were also published:—

    With the help of these and such other books, N. Venkata Rao
 wrote a voluminous book, Dakshina ’DesiyofJkra Vangnujycanu^
 published by the University of Madras in 1955. About the same
 time, N. Venkataramanayya wrote a shorter book on the same
 subject.
   Following the lines adopted by Viresalingam, N. Venkata Rao-
has been writing the “ Lives of Telugu Poets ” afresh. The first
volume was published in 1955 by the Madras University. It
includes also the authors of inscriptions in verse.
   In 1957 the Madras, University published Vol. I of Andhra
 Vmgmaya Charitra Sarvasvamu (A Complete History of Telugu
Literature—^From the beginning to A.D. 1375) by S. Rama*
krishna Sastri. This is the first of its kind. It deals not merely
with Telugu poets and their lives but also presents a critical account
of their works.
   Some other scholars wrote books on Telugu poets and Telugu:
literature as detailed below:—

        (1) Chaganti Seshayya—Andhra Kavi Tarangini in ten volumes^
        (2) Suravaram Pratapa Reddi — Golconda Kavula Sanchika,
        (3) Madhunapantula Satyanarayana Sastri — Andhra
              Rachayitalu.
       (4) Vanguri Subba Rao — Scdakakavula Charitra and Andhra

       (7) Khandavalli Lakshmiranjanam — Andhra Vangmaya
             Charitra Sangrahamu.

- With the help of all these books, Bulusu Venkataramanayya
published in 1956 his Andhra Kavisr^tasati which gives a bief account
of 700 Telugu poets and the names of the poetsjare arranged in the
alphabetical order. At the end of the book the names of their
books are also arranged in similar order:

                   (m) Grammar and Philology

   Andhra Sabda Chintamani is generally believed to be the first
Telugu grammar, and pandits believed that Nannaya wrote it.
But it is now proved to be a grammar of a later origin. Yelakuchi
Balasarasvati of about 1600 wrote a Telugu commentary on it
known as Balasarasvatiyamu. Ahobalapati of about 1660 wrote
in Telugu as well as Sanskrit a commentary on the same grammar.
Mulaghatika Ketana wrote Andhra Bhasha Bhushanamu, a short
Telugu grammar in verse. In the introductory verses the author
says that he is the first to write a Telugu grammar.
   Bhima Kavi of the 12th century wrote Kavijanasrayamu in verse
a book on prosody. Anantamatya of the 15th century wrote
Chhandodarpanamu another book on prosody. Kakunuri Appa Kavi
wrote a book on prosody and giammar which is generally known
as Appakaviyamu in the 17th century, but the portion relating to
grammar is incomplete. He refers to several writers on these
subjects prior to him, and proudly asserts that alf the information
given by them is included in his book, and there is no need for
consulting them. Kuchimanchi Timma Kavi of the 18th century
wrote Sarva Lakshanasara Sangrahamu which looks like supple¬
mentary information to what is given by Appa Kavi. Adidamu
Sura Kavi of the 18th century wrote Kavijanatanjanamu and Kavi
Samsaya Vichhedamu-hoo)iis on metre and grammar. All these books
were written in verse.
   Paravaslu Chinnava Suri of the 19th century was the first to
wjitc his grammar known as Bala Vyakaranamu in prose. But it was
like Sanskrit grammars in Sutras, requiring the help of commen¬
taries. It is also defective from his own standpoint. A few years
later Bahujanapalli Sitaiamacharyulu wrote Prmdha Vyakaranamu
known also as Trilingalakshana seshamu in which the defects of
Bala Vyakaranamu were to some extent set right. Neither of these
two grammars refers to the usage of either contemporary or previous
poets. In spite of these defects Chinnaya Sun’s Bala Vyakaranamu
was accepted by tlie pandits as the standard grammar. It had
a baneful effect on the texts of the works of the ancient Telugu
poets, because when they were printed the usage of the poets was
revised by the pandits in accordance with the rules of grammar
of Chinnaya Suri. It is something like putting the cart before the
horse.
      17
258                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATUilB

    Later on, G. V. Ramamurti in his BaMauisaranyamu (1934)
 presented more than sixty instances of the usag^ of the poets for
 which provision had not been made in Balavycdcaranamu. But
 before his Balakamsaranyamu was published in 1933, he had given
 a list of such forms to Malladi Suryanarayana Sastri, who in¬
 corporated most of them in his Andhra Bhashanusasanamu published
in 1926.
   In 1937 Chilukuri Narayana Rao wrote Andhra Bhasha Charitramu
in two volumes. It is a voluminous work which incorporates all
the good features of the previous grammars and presents adequate
material for the construction of a historical grammar of the Telugu
language.
   In 1947 Ganti Jogi Somayaji published his Andhra Bhasha
Vikasamu. It is an endeavour to trace the history of the Telugu
language.
   Korada Ramakrishnayya had previously written several books
relating to the Telugu language and Dravidian Philology. Both
Somayaji and Ramakrishnayya maintained the Dravidian
origin of Telugu while Narayana Rao had made a heroic effort to
establish his theory that Telugu was of Aryan origin.
   Of Ramakrishnayya’s books DaKshina Desa Bhasha Sarasvatanuilu
(Desi in the south Indian languages and literature) and Bhasha
Charitraka Vyasamulu are important.
   In recent years Vadlamudi Gopalakrishnayya has written two
valuable books—Prachina Vangmayamulo Vyavakanka Bhasha and
Vyavaharika Bhasha Vyakaranamu,
   Short books on the usage of Telugu expression were written by
several scholars like Vedam Venkataraya Sastri, Veturi Prabhakara
Sastri, Dipala Pichhaya Sastri and N. Venkata Rao.
   In this connection, mention may be made of Tirumala Rama
chandra*s Mana Lipi Puttu puraottaralu (the evolution of the
Telugu script).
   Vajjhala China Sitaramaswami Sastri (1878) a great scholar of
Telugu and Sanskrit, who was, during the last years of Gurazada
Appa Rao (1911-1915) an advocate of the Modem Telugu
movement, became an advocate of die classical or ka^ya dialect
even for Telugu prose.     He has published two voluminous books
on Telugu grammar, known as Andhra Vyakarana Sarcasoam which
incorporates all the points mentioned in all the Tdlugu grammars
of the past. He is regarded as an authority on that subject*
NEW trends: prose                                          259
  G. V. Sitapati, Ravuri Dorasvami Sarma, Vadlamudi Gopala
Krishnayya, Chilukuri Papayya Sastri and several other scholars
have published many articles on grammar and prosody.
                         CHAPTER XIV

           New Trends In Modern Literature:
                 Drama And Theatre.
   There were no Tclugu dram-is, either original or translations,
prior to 1870 A.D. That docs not however mean that the Telugu
people had no notion of the dramatic art. Sanskrit scholais
among the Telugus were*well acquainted with Sanskrit dramas;
but they ncvci attempted to vviite diamas on the model of Sanskrit
plays. Theie were Tclugu poets who translated the AlahabhaiatCy
the Ramayava and the Bha^aia^a but none ol them translated any
Sanskrit drama. An eminent 'relu<?n poet, Pillalamarri Pma
Virabhadra of the 15th century composed a lengthy Telugu poem,
Snnqara Sakuntalam, adapting Kalidasa's Abhtjnnna Sakuntalam and
also the original story of Sakuntala, picsented m the Mahabharata.
Likewise, another Sanskiit diama, Prabodhathnndtndayamy was
rendered as a poem in Telugu by the twin-poets, Nandi hlallana
and Ghanta Singana of the 15th centuiy A.D. We do not hear of
any Telugu dtama — of the type of Sanskrit drama; nor do we
come across any reference to a regular theatre in the Telugu
country prior to 1870 A.D. This is indeed a strange feature, but
we can account foi it.
   As a substitute for drama, there had been Vakshaganas or per¬
formances by Bhagavata parties, also known as Vitht natakas or
street-plays. The theme selected was in the beginning, exclusively
from an episode in the Bhagavata, but in course of time, stoiies
from the Mahabharata and the Ramayana also were selected as
suitable themes. They were composed with a large admixture
of song and verse, and provided for dancing as an essential part
of the Dance-Drama. They were almost like the operas of the West
and were, therefore, more attractive to the people than the dramas
of the type of Sanskrit plays.
   Such street-plays have waned in popularity, though they still
linger in a few villages. Fashionable persons with modem tastes^
somekimes attend them out of antiquarian interest.      Institutions
like the Sangeet Natak Akademi are trying to raise the level of the
Dance Dramas, and bring them into closer relationship with the:
art revival in modem India.

snsw trends: drama and theatre                                    261
                             (a) Drama

    The Telugu poets were of the opinion that a drama was a
 drisyakavya and meant primarily to be staged; and they were not
 confident that the performance of plays resembling the Sanskrit
 plays, would interest the people so well as the Takshaganas or
 street plays. Mere acting and dialogue would not attract the
 masses, unless tliey were combined with singing and dancing.
    With the advent of the English theatre in India, and the per¬
 formance of the plays of Shakespare anchother English playwrights,
 the educated classes who studied the plays at college evinced
 interest in enacting them and translating them into Telugu.
 Parsi theatrical companies from Dharwar and Poona toured
 the Telugu country and their performances of Hindi or Marathi
 plays with attractive curtains and scenic arrangements created
 a favourable impression. The need for similar dramas in Telugu
was felt. About the same time, the performance of Sanskrit
 dramas was encouraged by Ananda Gajapati, Maharaja of Vizia-
 nagaram, a versatile scholar and patron of Art and Letters. A
 Dramatic Association was organised, and a theatre was built in
the Maharaja’s palace for staging Sanskrit plays before select
audience of pandits and modern scholars.
    As a result of these developments, there emerged translations
of English and Sanskrit dramas and finally original plays in Telugu.
 In 1876, Vavilala Vasudeva Sastri translated Julius Ceasar into
Telugu. He was a graduate of the Madras University and an
assistant lecturer in English in the Government Arts College,
Rajahmundry. He adopted a popular metre in Telugu, every
line of which consisted of five feet corresponding to the five iambic
feet of Shakespeare’s composition, and Telugised the English
proper names. He also tried to introduce Hindu customs and
manners to make the play popular in the Telugu country. In
 1880 both Guruzada Sriramamurti of Vizianagaram and K. Viresa-
lingam of Rajahmundry translated the first two acts of the Merchant
of Venice; the former introduced a few prose passages but the
major portion was in verse, while the latter did it entirely in verse.
These translations were followed by a number of other translations
of English dramas, not only of Shakespeare but also of Sheridan
and, later on, of Ibsen and of other foreign playwrights. Of these
foreign plays, Shakespeare’s appealed most to the Telugu writers.
262                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

more than twelve dramas of Shakespeare werj translated or
 adapted, and Viresalinganf translated more plays than any other;
but they appealed only to the educated classes but not to the
people in general. Even today stories relating to the social or
political life of foreign countries do not appeal to the people in
general.
   Side by side with the translation or adaptation of these foreign
plays, the translation of Sanskrit plays also progressed. Kokkonda
Venkataratnam, a great Sanskrit and Telugu scholar, was the
first to translate a Sanskrit drama known as Narakasura Vijaya
 Vyayogam but it failed to become popular on account of its difficult
style. K. Viresalingam was the second Telugu scholar to translate
Sanskrit dramas. He translated Abhijnma Sakmtalam and Rainavalu
His translation of Abhijnana Sakunlalam is considered to be the best
among more than a dozen translations of the same play by con¬
temporary and subsequent scholars. Many other Sanskrit plays
of Bhavabhuti, Bhasa, Sudraka, and Bhattanarayana have been
translated by later writers, but only a few of them like Vemsam-
haraniy translated by ^’’addadi Subbarayudu, were popular on the
stage. 1900-1910 seems to be the most favourable period for
translations of Sanskrit dramas and in later years this type of
literary work has been comparatively rare.
   Along with tlie translation of English or Sanskrit plays, came
also original dramas in Telugu by almost the same authors as
had done translations. Korada Ramachandra Kavi’s Manjari
Madkukariyam was the first original Telugu drama (1860), but
it was not popular on the stage. Vavilala Vasudeva Sastri*s
Nandakarajyam in 1880, was the second original drama but as it was
composed completely in verse, it could not be easily staged. It
has to be explained here that the Telugus have always been
accustomed to sing any verse, but not to deliver it as ryhthmic
prose. Viresalingam was the third to write an original drama.
His Hanschandra became very popular, because the theme was
well-known, the dialogues were vigorous, and the development of
the plot was after the model of Sanskrit plays. Its popularity on
the stage lasted till Balijepalli Lakshmikantam’s Harischimdra
attracted larger audiences in several parts of the Telugu country.
The dramatic situations were better worked up by BalijepaUir
because he was also an actor.

 Dramatic Associations were Dharmavaram Krishnamacharya
  (1853-1913) and Kolachalam Srinivasa Rao contemporaries and
 rivals in the dramatic field and both of them lawyers of Bellary.
 They were the products of English education and their plays
 illustrate the influence of English dramas and western technique
 in dramaturgy. Krishnamacharya wrote his plays for the Sarasa
  Vinodini Sabha of Bellary. He had the courage to write the first
 tragedy in Telugu, known as Vishada Sarangadkara, defying the
 tradition of the country which favoured only a happy ending for
 any drama—Puranic, historical or sociak He gave up the tradi¬
 tional JVandi and Prastavana of the Sanskrit plays and introduced
 prologues and epilogues on the model of the English plays. At
 the same time he followed the traditions of the country in descrip¬
 tions, figures of speech and indications of social, ethical and
 spiritual values. Many of his dramas were based on puranic
 themes of which his Chtra Naliyam, Prahlada and Paduka Patta-
 hhiskekam have been regarded as the best. He had also the honour
of having written an all-prose drama Ajamilam. He wrote, in
 all, thirty dramas, and is known as the Andhra Nataka Pitamaha,
the “ Grand- father of the Andhra Drama ”.
    Kolachalam Srinivasa Rao on account of some differences with
Krishnamacharya, started a rival Dramatic Association at Bellary,
    He was also a prolific writer having to his credit nearly 30 plays.
While Krishnamacharya was famous for his Puranic dramas,
Srinivasa Rao came to be regarded as the first great writer of
historical plays. His Vijayanagara Samrajya Patanam (Fall of
Vijayanagar Empire) is the best of his plays.
    The Sugunavilasa Sabha of Madras came into existence about the
same time as the Sarasa Vinodini Sabha of Bellary. This Sabha
staged Telugu dramas and also dramas in some other South Indian
languages. There was no playwright who wrote plays for this
Sabha in Telugu, while P. Sambandam Mudaliar, wrote more than
80 plays in Tamil. Mudaliar is known to be a very good actor
and he used to take part in Telugu dramas also.
    Several theatrical societies came into existence during the last
years of the 19th and the early years of the 20th century in Madras
and several towns of the Telugu country, of which the Chintaman»
Pataka Samqjam at Rajahmundry and the Jaganmitra NaUdea
Sanu^am at Visakhapatnam were the earliest to come to {nrominence.
Guntur, Narasarac^t, Tenali, Gudivada, Machilipatnsun (Masuli-

patnam), Eluru, Nellore and a few other places ^Iso had each a
Dramatic Association. The late Emani Lakshmana Swami df
Masulipatam and his fellow-members of the National Theatre,
used to enact plays in Hindi, which were greatly appreciated.
There were also a few piofessional louring parties like the Surabhi
companies. One interesting feature about them was that each
troupe consisted almost exclusively of members of the same extended
family. Women also took part in the performances, and as far
as possible the roles were so distributed that each was the wife of
her own husband on the*stage also. They had a stock of about
ten dramas. They had a successful life for about 15 years but
after the advent of the cinema, their parties were broken up and
the surviving actors and actresses entered this new field. One
main defect with them was that the dramas were so wiittcn by
their playwrights as to suit the talents of their permanent aiiistfs.
This prevented the selecting of new aitistes for their dramas.
   At Rajahmundry there were gifted writers like Chilakamarti
Lakshminarasimham and Vaddadi Su))barayudu whose dramas
were popular all over the Telugu country particularly Chilaka-
maiti's Prasannayadavam and Gayopakhyanam.
   Rasaputra Vijayam by Ichchapurapu Yajnanarayana of Visakha-
patnam had remarkable success during the first quarter of th’s
century, because it exhibited the valour of the Rajput heroes like
Raj Simha and Durgadas who fought for freedom against
Mussalman chiefs and rulers. For simlar reasons, Roshamra by
Kopparapu Subba Rao was very popular for some years, but the
Mussalmans were displeased with it and the performance of the
play was, therefore, banned. Puranic dramas like Pandava Vtjayam
by Tirupati Venkateswara (twin) Kavuiu,5'ri Krishna Tulabharam by
Muttarazu Subba Rao; historical plays like Khiljirajya Patanam
by Gundimeda Venkata Subba Rao and Vindhya Rani and Na Raju
of P. Nagendra Rao, translations of D. L. Roy’s Bengali Dramas
like Chandragupta, Shajahan and Durgadas by several writers like
Sripada Kamesvara Rao, Nanduri Siva Rao and Jonnalagadda
Satyanarayana Murti became popular on the stage. Most of
them are still staged at several places.
   I shall here refer to two dramas that have had the unrivalled
appreciation of the Telugus, because of their high quality.
 Prataparudriyam (1896) by Vedam Venkj|taraya Sastri, a great
 Sanskrit and Telugu Pandit with conunendable scholarship in
HEW trends: draua and theatre                                   265

English, was mainly a historical play dealing with an event in
Kakatiya history. King Prataparudra, according to thw play,
was kidnapped by the Mohammedan soldiers while he was resting
after a hunt. He was taken as a captive to Delhi, but rescued by
his minister Yugandhara, an extraordinary strategist of the type
of Chanakya. It is a lengthy drama with plots and counterplots
woven into it, and amazing dramatic situations, vigorous dialogues,
and scenes of comic interest. The author who was ordinarily
against the use of the spoken dialect even of the cultured classes
for serious composition, made use of 4he dialect appropriate to
the inferior characters in his drama. But in the case of the
higher roles, he employed the poetic diction of classical poems.
The construction of the plot and the characterisation are superb.
The drama affords excellent reading and ample scope for acting
on the stage. It is still a very popular drama. But it suffers from
a grave defect in the execution of the plot. The Sultan’s men
captured Prataparudra on the outskirts of Warangal and took
him to Delhi in a boat, and Yugandhara brought him back
along with the Sultan in a boat from Delhi to Warangal.
   The second drama of outstanding merit is Kanyasulkam (1897),
a social play by Gurazada Appa Rao of Vizianagaram. It was
revised and enlarged in 1909. The author was a brilliant scholar
in English, with a liberal outlook. He kept himself abreast of
his times. In the introduction to his drama, he says “ I wrote
to advance the cause of social reform and to combat a popular
prejudice that the Telugu language (by which he meant the
spoken dialect) was unsuited to the stage_” The late
Dr. G. R. Reddy (a former Vice-Chancellor of the Andhra
University) was not in favour of the Modem Telugu movement
sponsored by G. V. Ramamurti and Appa Rao. But he did not
&il to appreciate this drama which adopted, throughout the play,
the spoken dialect. He says: Kanyasulkam remains a master-piece
in the difficult realm of social satire. It is aglow with life and
humanity; its men and women move about with all the grace and
kindness, oddities and absurdities, cruelties and chicaneries,
sanctities and hypocrisies of real life — a life in which nature and
eustoms, reason and tradition, sentiment and superstition are in
miserable conflict. The characters in the drama were drawn on
realities of life; the author had in his mind some of his con¬
temporaries whose traits of character helped him portray the
main characters of his drama.”
 266                                 HISTORY OF TSLUOU UTERATOBS

      A social play intended to advance the cause of social reform or
  correct the social ^ils of the age may be popul^ for a period^
  but unlikely to interest the future generations that do not suffer
  from such evils nor face such problems. Such were the other
  social dramas in Telugu — either contemporaneous with, or a
  little earlier or later than Kanyasulkam such as Manorama (1895)
  by Achanta Sankhyayana Sarma and Sagarika (1897) by Valluri
  Bapirazu and several farces — prahasanams (1895-1900) by
  Viresalingam — all intended to combat the social evils of the age
  and to advance education «among women. They faded out of the
  memory of the present generation because the problems referred
  to in them are out of date. But the case of Kanyasulkam is different*
  The bride’s price, as is indicated in the title of the drama is no-
  longer in vogue, and it has been replaced by the bridegroom’s
  price. And yet, Kanyamlkam is not stale. There are a good many
 other features of society which still persist, and the creation of
 immortal characters like Girisam, Venkatesam, Karataka Sastri
 and Madhuravani invests the play with the halo of permanence.
     In the history of Telugu Drama, Panuganti Lakshmi Narasimha
 Rao (1895-1940) deserves special notice. He was a prolific
 writer with a facile pen; his writings covered almost every branch
 of literature except p>oetry. He was not an eminent poet,
 though he composed verses in his dramas. He was a good play¬
 wright and a vigorous prose writer. His dramas, essays and
 sketches illustrate his profound scholarship, his insight into human
 nature and his creative art — particularly in creating typical
 characters representative of all time. He developed a satirically
 humorous style of writing, aimed principally at evil-doers in
society. He wrote many dramas giving' prominence to prose»
and the few verses were so composed that they afforded little
scope for the usual singing on the stage. Of his dramas,.
Paduka Pattahhishekam and Radhakrishna — with Puranic themes —
and Kanthabharanam and Vriddhavivaham — social plays — have
literary merit and have become popular on the stage.
    There are also some plays that afford good reading on accomit
of their literary quality and creative art — Modi Sundari, a good
lyrical play by Abburi Ramakrishna Rao; several g^a natakamuh
(all verse plays) like Padmavati Charana Charana Ckakravarti and
Dikshiia Duhita by Sivasankara Svami. Some ^modern writers have
followed the example set by this poet.
 NSW 'TRENDS: DRAMA AND THEATRE                                       267
    ITic Yuvarajah of Pithapuram, R. V. M. G, Rama Rao, a
 realistic poet and playwright who was influenced by the Modem
 Telugu movement and the new trends of the age, has written some
 plays like Aa lokammundi Ahvancm and Tirani Korikalu • atarvata
 which exhibit free flights of conception, defying all conventions.
 His Varudhini based on the story of Peddana’s Mamcharitra^ dis¬
 plays an interesting feature in compositon. He makes use of
 Peddana’s verses, taken from the dialogue to create two new
 characters (the friends of Varudhini) who employ the verses to
 describe the incidents of the story.        •
    Muddukrishna, a typical product of the modern age, has written
 short social plays like Tikappulo tupanu (a storm in a tea cup) and
 Bhtmakalapam — interesting comedies popular on the stage.
    P. V. Rajamannar, better known for his playlets, wrote a full-
 length social play Tappevaridt (whose is the fault ?) in such a realistic
 and convincing manner that it was staged successfully in Madras
 and other places. Manorama is his next best drama.
   The Matyakala Pamhat started about 1928 at Tenali as a result
 of the exertions of Raghavachari, the famous Telugu actor, and
Vanarsa Govinda Rao of Surabhi, encouraged playwrights by
 ofFciing prizes and awards. Atreya, Kondamudi Gopalaraya
 Sarma and others have thus been induced to write plays for the
modem stage. Themes relating to the downtrodden labourers,
peasants, ill-paid clerks, N.G.O.’s are on the increase, by authors
who have communist and socialist views. They are all written
in the spoken dialect — appropriate to the characters of the drama.
   There are more than 1500 Telugu dramas and it is not possible
to mention them all here. I shall, however, mention some of the
more important, either by virtue of their poetic merit or their
popularity on the stage.
   Rjtip^oimanitam by Rayaprolu Subba Rao is a high-class allegorical
play ^neant not for the stage but for close study. It relates to the
idealistic development of love.
   Pramadvara by Svayampakula Adiseshayya has for its theme the
marriage of Pramadvara and Manmatha. It has been commended
by scholars like D. Ramanuja Rao and D. Venkatavadhani.
   Narasanm bhatlu, by Vinjamuri Lakshmi Narasimha Rao, a
poet, playwright and actor, relates to an interesting episode in the
history of the       Vamsat ancestors of the Maharaja of Pithapuram.
   Mddana SkguAam by Yellapantula Js^annathana^ a poet, and
268                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

author of several books on religion and philosophy, is based on
 the well known story of Ritudhvaja. It has literary merit and is
successful on the stage.
   Translations of Sanskrit dramas of Bhasa, Bhavabhuti,
Dingnagacharya (by Vedam Venkatakrishna Sarma) and of
Sarvajna Singabhupala have appeared in recent years.
   Raqa Vasishthamy by Boyi Bhimanna, is a classico-social drama
which indicates the status of Harijans in ancient India, and the
liberal attitude of the Rishis. It largely depends on the tradition
that Arundhati, wife of Vasishtha, belonged originally to a family
of outcastes but won pre-eminence through her devotion and
virtue.
   Among the recent play-wrighls, the most prominent are —
Mandalaparti Upendra Sarma whose Kaimodpu illustrates the
literary life of Tikkana and his contemporary poets.
   Pinisetti Srirama Murti whose playlet Anna^Chellelu (Elder brother
and younger sister) is so composed that the entire story has a
continuity of actiuji at one single place, though actors enter and
exit; and his Pallcpaduchu in eight scenes depicts the progressing
social life of the present day villages.
   Ghedalavada Pichchayya’s Pratiksha is a social play in which
the conflict of ideals between the more advanced and the less
advanced persons of the present day is reflected.
   Chillara Bhavanarayana’s dramas — Uppenay Parinamaniy
Pichchivadu and Kalajivi are frequently enacted by the Pfai^a Kala
Samiti of Hyderabad.

                           (b) Dramaturgy

   Puranam Suri Sastri wrote some books like Natakotpalam and
J\fatyambujam in which he discussed the fundamental principles of
dramaturgy in recent years. Ponangi Sri Rama Appa Rao
published (1959) his Telugu translation of Bharaia Natya Sastra and
presented vivid commentary in Telugu based upon the commentary
of Abhinava Guptapada. Another scholar who has studied the
subject is Srinivasa Chakravarti, editor of Nataka Kala» He has
also prepared for UNESCO a Bibliography of the Telugu dramas
fit for the stage. Nataka Silpamu by Rohini is a short book relating
to the technique of the stage, acting and performance.
   Kota Sundararama Sarma’s Pradyunmabhyudayamu is a translation
 MEW trends: drama and theatre                                     269
 of the Sanskrit drama by Ravivarma Bhupala. Pingali Surana*s
 famous poem Prabhavati Pradyumnam was based on the same theme.

                     (c) Sfiort plays and one-act plays

      Short plays and one-act plays have recently developed in Telugu
   literature. They owe their origin to a study of western plays;
   they have nothing in common with Sanskrit plays. There are
   some translations of Bernard Shaw, Henrik Ibsen, Chekhov and
   others, but they could not attract the ordinary readers on account
   of the alien background and ideas. The original plays in Telugu
   have adopted only the technique of western writers. There are
   about a thousand one-act plays, but sev^eral of them arc not perfect
   in technique. There are histoiical, literary, social or merely
   entertaining plays, and plays having old themes with a modern
  interpretation.
      Historical plays:—Maremanda Rama Rao has written three
   playlets with historical themes. In his first play, the love that
  developed between Chhaya and Chandragupta, Ghanakya’s
  forbidding the union in the interests of the state, and the tragic
  end of the heroine constitute the theme. The second is based on
  the historical fact of Kumaragiri Reddi’s gift of a part of his king¬
  dom to Katayavema. The third relates to the cruel punishment
  meted out to Timmarasu .by Krishnadevaraya. Mtiddukrishna
  and Visvanatha Satyanarayana have written Anarkali, the tragic
  story connected with Salim and the danseuse whom he had loved.
  Some other historical plays worth mentioning arc Kompalle
  Janardana Rao’s Tansen; Malladi Avadhani’s Tara and some
  plays relating to Andhra history and Rajarazu by Sripada Subrah-
' manya Sastri.
      Literacy Plays are plays with themes taken from ancient classics-
  and ^Puranas, such as Chinta Dikshitulu’s Sabari, Renuka and
  Sarmislha. Sripada Subrahmanya Sastri’s plays are rich in dialogue
  and vigorous but simple in expression. Butchibabu's Omarkhayam
  is very interesting in the development of the plot. There are more
  literary plays in Telugu than historical.
      Social Plays are abundant. P. V. Rajamannar is an outstanding
  writer in this held.                 is the best of his plays. D^ala
  Lanka is equally good. Both of them appeal to the intellectuals
  because there is plenty of Dkvani (suggestive reference) in them.
 270                                 HISTORY OF TBLUOU LmSHATURB

  Narla Venkateswara Rao gives indications of his clear thinkiz^
  and insight into human nature, whether he writes a poem or a
  story or a play. Kottagadda (New Ground) is the name of his
  volume of collected playlets. Like an artistic potter, he creates
  characters that exhibit human nature in its rich variety. Svami
  Sivasankara Sastri’s Stri Virodhi depicts how love survives refusal
  and disappointment.
     Entertainment plays: M. Viswanatha Kaviraju and Bhamidipati
  Kamesvara Rao have contributed the largest number of plays of
  entertainment value.          Nagarajamatya’s Nava kavi, Misala
  Pakshulu etc. arc metrical plays and they are very interesting on
  account of the humourous and satirical element in them. The
  plays of Bhamidipati and Malladi are very frequently staged all
  over the Telugu country.
     Plays with new interpretations of old themes'. Some modernists
  project their thoughts or theories and reinterpret old stories.
  Feminist thought is prominent in Bhanumati^ Pankeyam, etc., by
 Gudipati Venkatachalam. Amancharla Gopala Rao depicts
 Hiranyakasipa as a communist. In his Mokkubadiy Mokkapati
 Narasimha Sastri gives his own interpretation with his habitual
 humour. G. V. Krishna Rao in his Bhikshapatra gives a new
 interpretation to the ideals of the Puranic heroes.
    K. VaUcuntha Rao has translated Grihapravesam and other
 plays from Bengali. B. Gk>pala Reddi’s Kaxdm-Devayani and
Chitrangada and six short plays are faithful translations of Rabindra¬
 nath Tagore’s plays. They are rich in diction and at the same
 time simple in style, though they are interspersed with Bengali
 turn of expression. This is almost inevitable in the case of one
who knows the Bengali language and has admiration for Tagore
and his style.
    Nori Narasimha Sastri published four playlets under the heading
of Tern tette in 1950. During his early years he wrote (1924) his
playlet Somanatha Vijayam entirely in prose and used the spoken
dialect of the cultured. It relates to the expedition of Mohammed
of Ghazni against the temple of Somanath and the wonder of the
idol standing in the centre of the shrine without any support.
    Boyi Bhimanna’s Padipotuma Addugodalu (the falling walls of
obstruction) is an interesting one-act play. The theme relates
to the status of Harijans in the Vedic period, their sul»equent fall
and rise in these days» But he desires to*|)oint out that their
 Hfftw TRBND9: DRAMA AND THEATRE                                    271

  happiness depends upon the attitude of the Savamas and Avamas*
  Boyi Bhimanna is a good poet and playwright
     G. Tripura Sundari wrote six one-act plays which received the
  State Award in 1955.
     Recently K. V. Gopalaswamy has hit upon a new technique
  for playlets. He encourages playwrights to write plays having
  the same scene from the beginning to the end. Dramatis personae
  may come and go but the same scene continues throughout, and
  all the incidents of the story occur in one place. Its great advantage
  lies in speedy action, and the scope for the display of the histrionic
  talent of the actor is by no means diminished. Plays employing
  this new technique are generally staged in t^e Andhra University
  theatre at Waltair. Ankitam by Paidipati Subbarama Sastri
  illustrates this technique.
     Kopparapu Subba Rao deserves special mention in this connec¬
  tion. He was a play-wright and his Roshanara and Tara Sasankam
  brought him great reputation in the country. In course of time
 he endeavoured to popularise the “ Little Theatre ” movement
  but was not successful for want of financial aid. His Tara Sasankam
 was very popular for a time, but since the theme is not edifying
 its popularity is waning. His shorter plays like JVeti JVatuduy Alii
 Mutha are still popular.
     In recent times short detective playlets are attempted. Korrapati
 Gangadhara Rao’s Prarthana (detective one-act play) is
 interesting.
     There are in Telangana good writers of short plays such as
 A. R. Krishna, Ambatipudi Venkataratnam, Bhamidipati Radha
 krishna and Vidiyala Chandrasekhara Rao.
     A short play known as Patita written by Gollapudi Maruti Rao
 received the prize offered by K, V. Gopalaswamy. The same
author wrote another short play known as Viluvalu (values). The
peculiarity about this play is the absence of women’s roles. Angara
Surya Rao’s plays are all interesting and his Natika received the
first prize on the occasion of “ Youth Festivities ”. Another
drama, GandapmderamUy relating to the story of Peddana, has been
written by Kesavapantula Narasimha Sastri. Somanchi Yajnanna
Sastri’s Rangabhimiy Lokulu Kakuluy Potukuchi Sambasiva Rao’s
Jdenia and PraHdhmnalUy and Gora Sastri’s Asa kharidu ana (the
cost of ambition is one anna) are good both for the stage and for
reading.

                           (d) Harikathas

  Harikathas arc, as the name indicates, stories of Vishnu but in
course of time, the name was used for a particular branch of
literature. When the literal meaning is lost, there may be Hari^
kathas of any deity or personality. We have now Harikathas of
Raja Rammohan Roy, of Gandhi and of Potti Sriramulu.
Kalakshepam was a term at first used along with Harikathas to mean
“ whiling away of time (usefully) with the story of Hari ”.
  The Harikatha performer delivers his Harikatha in prose, verse
and song to the accompaniment of the harmonium, a stringed
instrument like the violin and a dmm, and he holds a pair of
castanets in his hand. The composition may be his or another’s.
  Of the Harikatha performers who deliver their own compositions,
the outstanding personality was Azzada Adibhatla Narayana Das
of Vizianagaram (1864-1945). He was a great Sanskrit, Telugu,
English and Persian scholar. He was an accomplished musician.
He could sing melodiously yet loud enough to be heard by a
thousand people in the open air without any mike and loudspeaker.
He could also play on the Vina. He was an expert in music and
tala (or keeping time). As a poet, he composed Batasari as an
adaptation of CJoldsmith’s Traveller, and Beauties from Shakes¬
peare in melodious Telugu verse. With his knowledge of Persian
he translated Omar Khayyam into Sanskrit and Telugu. He
composed more than twenty Harikathas such as Sitakalyanam,.
Savitri and Rukminikalyanam. They exhibit his poetical talent,
imagination and knowledge of music. During his last days he
was composing Harikathas with a philosophic background. There
are many Harikatha performers who are proud of owning him as
Guru directly or indirectly.
                          APPENDIX I

                      Juvenile Literature

   There was no Juvenile Literature one hundred years ago.
Children commenced to learn the alphabet on an auspicious day
when they were four years and four months old, and after they had
learnt to read and write sentences in X^lugu, they were taught
to recite Telugu verses from Vemana Salakam and Sumati Satakam
and Andkranama San^raham (Telugu lexicon in verse). If the
parents had the desire that their children should learn Sanskrit
also, they taught them Amaram (Sanskrit lexicon in verse) as well
as Sabdamanjarif and Balaramayanam. Children of advanced age
learnt Rukmxmkalyanam and Gajendmmoksham from the Telugu
BhagaveUam of Potana. This was all the juvenile literature that
children had in the past, and this traditional education for children
continued almost till the end of the nineteenth century. Side by
side with this formal education children learnt some verses and
songs of the type of the Janapadageyas and listened to the stories of
the folklore type narrated to them by the elders in the house —
generally grandfeithcrs and grandmothers.
  Juvenile literature of the modern type had a very modest
beginning in the last decades of the 19th century, when the Christian
Missionaries published small illustrated books in Telugu for
children. Encouraged by them, Telugu scholars like Ramayya,
Suri and Surya Prakasa Rao published a few songs and stories
foi children. Pandit Silarama Sastri published in 1846, Pedda
Bala Sikska which was a concise book of general knowledge for
children of the age group of eight to ten years; and this is still in
use in many villages, having undergone a few revisions and enlarge*
ments. Viresalingam published in the last decade of the nine*
teenth century, translations into Telugu verse of some of the fables
of Aesop. Later on, appeared some Satakas for children — boys
and girls, like Kumara Satakam and Kuman Satakam and they were
intended to teach children good manners and morals. With the
same object in view Vavilikolanu Subba Rao published in the
early years of the 20th century easy stories from the Ramayanay
the MaJuxbhorata and the Bhagasata, and Kimata Hitackaiya and
     18                           273
274                                HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

Kumari Hitacharya on the model of Cobbet’s advice to young
men. All these books were in the classical language, though a
simple style was adopted. They were also intended to serve as
gateways to the study of Telugu classics. None of them could be
read or understood without the help of a teacher. Nor was there
any book that could attract children or appeal to their imagination.
There were, however, two interesting books “ Travel to Asia ”
and Travel to Europe ” published in 1897. The latter is more
interesting. It relates to a boy, Sri Ramulu of a cultured family.
On account of his illness, he had to stay behind in India while
his parents, brothers and sisters went on a tour to Europe. He
was regularly having letters from every one of his relatives and
  rom every country in Europe they visited. Later on, when
Sri Ramulu was of age to travel alone, he visited foreign countries
and he wrote letters to his relatives. The letters are attractive to
children because they present interesting descriptions of the fine
places visited and of the children there.
    Juvenile literature entirely of the modern type had its commence¬
ment in 1909-1910. G. V. Sitapati was the earliest to start it.
His songs such as Chtlakamma pendli (the parrot’s marriage) and
Railu bandi (the Railway train) were published in a monthly
magazine, Vivekavati at Guntur in those years. Though they
were interesting to children, that type of literature was not
encouraged by the elders, mainly because they were composed in
 the spoken dialect, and the country was not prepared to accept
 it for children. As they were attractive, they were published
 in Longman’s and Macmillan’s Telugu Readers with slight
 changes in the text. The spoken forms were converted into the
 conventional grammatical forms to satisfy the requirements of
 the Education Department. Later on, his short stories for children
 such as Anumanam Pembkutam (suspicion, the dreadful demon)
 and Pichchasupatri (the lunatic assylum) were published in Vigu^
juldca, a Telugu monthly at Berhampore (Gai\jam District) in
  1918-1919. In course of time appeared the more attractive and
 more artistic songs and stories of Ghinta Dikshitulu. His
 pidatalu (lacquered wooden toys) was a collection of his short poems
 for children.
     Sun Siti Venki attracted little chil^en and his Hmmqntmi
  (tail of Hanuman) is a very humourous short poem composed in
  ballad metre. IMa Sundari is his master^ece among short stories
appendix I—juvenile ltmerature                                    275

 in prose for children. It is a fairly lengthy story composed on the
 model of “ Alice in Wonderland *’ and some other stories. About
 the same time, Venkata Parvatisvara Kavulu (twin poets) published
 their illustrated Bharatam, Bhagavatam and Ramayanam in the
 conventional literary language, but in a very simple style to attract
 children and also satisfy the requirements of the educational
 authorities.
     The progress of juvenile literature was destined to be slow
 because the Educational authorities would not recognise the
 spoken dialect. Books for children cou]d not be attractive unless
 they were written in the spoken dialect; but they could not
 command a good sale in the country unless they were recognised
 by the text book committee. Juvenile literature had been till a
 few years ago subject to this vicious circle. There is still the
 formal ban on the use of the spoken dialect in school and college
 books. There has been however, during the last fifteen years an
 increasing demand for juvenile literature irrespective of any
 recognition by the Educational department.
     In 1940 when G. V. Sitapati was in charge of editing the Bharati
 an important Telugu monthly, two pages were set apart for Kings
 and stories under the caption of Balamndamy and this reservation
 of space for juvenile literature has been followed by almost all
 other Telugu journals — weeklies and monthlies. In 1945,
 appeared Bala a monthly journal exclusively devoted to juvenile
 literature (vide Journalism) but it stopped in 1950. Later than
 Bala there appeared some other journals like BaUmitra. Chandamama
 (imcle Moon) was edited by Ghakrapani, assisted by a group of
 veteran writers like K. Kutumba Rao, and Mudda Visvanatham.
 BaUmitra is entirely devoted to little children while Chandamama
 appeals to grown-up boys and girls and to adults with little
 leading. Chandamama is therefore the most widely circulated
Journal. It is very interestii^ to note that it appears in several
other languages also viz., Tamil, Kannada, Hindi, Marathi and
 Gujarati.
    JuvoiUe literature has, during the last five years made consi¬
derable progress in quality and quantity with the encouragement
given by the Ttlagu Bhasha Samiti and the Government of both
Gcashoe and State       by awarding prizes to the best books for
AlMldyen of the age g^roups of 3 to 7 and of 7 to 14 years. The
award of the- Central government was nccived by Ghinta Dikahl*
276                                  HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

 tulu, M. Bapineedu, G. V. Sitapati, Nataraja Ramakrishna^
 V. Subrahmanyam, B. V. Narasimha Rao, Avantsa Lakshmana
 Rao and S. Krishna Rao. The award of the State of Andhra
 Pradesh was received by G. V. Sitapati, Chinta Dikshitulu, Koduri
 Lilavati, Devulapalli Bujjai and others. The State Award through
 the agency of the Telugu Bhasha Samiti was received by
 M. Bapinredu, G. V. Sitapati and P. Sitarajyalakshmi.
    In addition to the institution of awards, the Central government
 has been encouraging the growth of juvenile literature by organizing
 Literary Workshops {Bal(k. Sahitya Rachanalayas) to train authors
in the technique of writing books for children. The first workshop
was held at Rajahmundry in 1956 and the second at Hyderabad
in 1958 (Nov) to 1959 (Jan). G. V. Sitapati was appointed as the
Director of both the woikshops. At each place forty authors
were trained and every one of them wrote a book — either poems
or stories or both. Some of the trainees such as B. V. Narasimha
Rao, Utpala Satyanarayanacharyulu and Avantsa Lakshmana
Rao have come to prominence by the publication of their books.
While the books of the trainees at Rajahmundry could not be
published for want of adequate financial aid, all the forty books
of the forty tramecs at Hyderabad have been printed and,
published with the financial aid of the Central government.
   The early writers were under the impression that only poems
and short stories and songs constituted Juvenile literature, and
that schools would provide for the text-books relating to history^
geography and science.       In course of time, authors realised that
it was possible and desirable to write books on these subjects also,
not as serious text-books but as artistic pieces of Juvenile literature
that could afford pleasant reading and at the same time enrich
the knowledge of children in all possible ways. Learning with
tears which prevailed in the past decades has now become learning
widi delight. From the painful study of the tiresome text-booJ^
in the so-called classical language children now turn to delightful
and attractively illustrated books with gusto because they can be
easily understood without the help of a teacher. If modem
Telugu is recognised by the Government, school books can be
made as interesting as these books of Juvenile literature.
   In addition to the writers already mentioned, there are many
authors who have written for children. Medicherla Anjaneya^
murti (CAima, doma — ant and mosquito), Tekumalla Kamesvava

  Bala Annaya {Badiganta — School bell), Alaparti Venkata Subba

 Razugari chiluka — rajah’s parrot), Ghalla Radhakrishna Sarma
 [Anagmaga — once upon a time, Bekabekalu—the croaks of frogs.)
    There are also writers of scientific and other subjects for children
 such as Vemarazu Bhanumurti {Telephone^ Sabda prapancham)t
 Velaga Venkatappayya {Telephone)^ Janamanchi Ramakrishna
 {Adagandi Chebutanu—^ask and I’ll tell you), Bommakanti Srinivasa*
oharyulu {Manishiy devudu — man and God), Madduluri Rama-
krishna Rao {Ma hatha vintara? — will you listen to our stories by
animals), G. V. Ramamurti {Kambadani Saimvtdu—unseen enemies,
germs and disease) and Vintaprakriti (wonderful nature, regarding
worms and insects).
    There are yet many others who have written short stories,
verses, and songs, and biographies of national heroes. For want
of space 1 cannot give a complete list. I may add that many of
these books are not in the language of the children.
                          APPENDIX II

                           Journalism

   Viresalingam was again the first to start journalism in Telugu^
In 1885 appeared a weekly known as Vtvekaoardhani edited by him
and published from Rajahmundry. It was mainly devoted to-
literature. In 1886 A. P, Parthasarathi Naidu of Madras started
his weekly known as Andhra Prakasika and vigorously criticised the
policy of the British Government which, he felt was not conducive
to the prosperity of Indians. It was very popular and it continued
for about 25 years. Desabhtmani^ a fortnighty and later a weekly
was started in the same year at Guntur by D. Seshachalapati Rao.
It voiced the legitimate aspirations of the people and in 1912
became an Anglo-Telugu Daily for a brief period. The weekly
was continued till the death of the founder in 1922. Sasirekha
started by Guntupalli Seshayya was devoted to the cause of the
Andhra Movement. Though popular, it had to be discontinued
for want of funds.
   Monthly journals came into existence under the editorship of
Chilakamarti Lakshmi Narasimham, Kokkonda Venkataratnam
and Viresalingam Pantulu. They published articles on literary
topics and reviews of books. Amudnta Grantha Chintamani, edited
by Pundla Ramakrishnayya of Nellcnre, rendered great service to
Tehigu literature by publishing the unpublished works of old
 poets. It was practically a journal of Vedam Venkataraya Sastri.
 Pandits indulged in bitter criticism of one another in that journal,
 as well as in the other journals mentioned above.
   Journalism during the early years of the 20th century may be
 said to be virtually a continuation of that of the previous century.
 But the language adopted, though classical, was simpler. Telugu
 was a monthly journal edited by G. V. Ramamurti in 1919-1920,
 About the same time Sripada Krishnamurti Sastri started his
  Vi^rayudhamuy with the main object of vanquishing the modem
 Telugu movement sponsored by Ramamurti. Sarada edited by
 Kauta Sri Rama Sastri, Jayanti edited by Visvanatha Satyanarayana
 and Kolavennu Ramakotiswara Rao aq^ Udt^mx edited by
 Kompalle Janardana Rao rendered great service to the growth
                                   278
  APPINBa n-^JOtTRNAUSM                                            279

    of modem literature in Tehisfu.       But all these journals were
    short lived.
       Andhra Sdiiiya Parishat Patrika was started at Kaktnada in 1912
    under the patronage of the Maharaja of Pithapuram and his
    influential friends. Though its main object of suppressing the
    Modem Telugu movement has not been fulfilled, it has rendered
    great service to Telugu literature fay publishing in parts the un*
   published works of the past. It is stUl alive but its popularity has
   declined.
      The Krishna Patrika was started as a fortnightly at Masulipatam
   in 1901 by the Krishna District Association and edited by Konda
   Venkatappayya and Dasu Narayana Rao. It was later converted
   into a Weekly. In 1907 Mutnuri Krishna Rao became the editor
   and proprietor. For four decades, he shaped the thought and
   outlook of the Telug^s by his admirable editorials and essays on
  art and literature, and on political and social problems.     There
  are thousands of Telugus today who acknowledge with gratitude
  the services rendered by Krishna Rao to the cause of culture and
  nationalism.
      After he passed away in 1945 the paper was edited jointly by
  Katuri Venkateswara Rao and Kolavennu Ramakotiswara Rao
  (Founder—Editor of the English cultural journal Trkmt) for some
  years and afterwards by Kamalakaia Venkata Rao. It has now
  passed into the hands of a new Proprietor and Editor, Mudxgonda
  Subrahmanya Sarma of Tenali and is published with a new featufe
 from Hyderabad.
     With Kasinadhuni Nagesvara Rao, Telugu journalism gained
 greater prominence. In 1906, he started Andhra Painka as a
 weekly, but issued it from Bombay. In 1914 he changed his
 residence from Bombay to Madras and commenced to issue hxi
 Andhra Patrika as a daily. It was edited, in succession by G. Kari
 Sarvothama Rao, Challa Seshagiri Rao and Ghalla Jagannatham.
 It has had an unbroken record of service and achievement, and
today it is one of the most important dailies in Telugu. In course
of time Nagesvara Rho started in 1923 a literary monthly known
as Bharati. The daily, Andhra Patrika was enriched by a literary
supplement to the Sunday Issue; and there was also a separate
illustrated weekly which has become very popular. Nageswara
Rao passed away in 1938; but the three journals, Daily, Weekly
and Monthly are flourishing utider the editorship of Nagesvara
Rao’s son-in-law, S. Sambhu Prasad.
280                               HISTORY OF TBLUOU LITERATURE

    In 1939 Ramnath Gk>enka started, along wjith his English
Daily, Indian Express^ the Telugu Daily Andhra PrcAka, which was
«dited first for a short time by Khasa Subba Rao and Nyapati
Narayanamurti and next for a long time by Narla Venkateswara
Rao. Under the editorship of Narla it became the most widely
circulated Telugu Daily. Like Andhra Patrika^ this daily was also
enriched by the Sunday literary supplement and by a separate
illustrated weekly. Unfortunately on account of some disputes
between the management and workers, all these papers had to be
stopped. They are nowj revived by a fresh management and
issued from Vijayawada under the editorship of Nilamrazu
Venkata Seshayya.
   Narla Venkateswara Rao became the Editor of a new Daily
Andhra Jyoti published from Vijayawada. About the same time
another new Daily, Andhra Bhumi was started at Hyderabad under
the editorship of P. Nageswara Rao. Andhra Bharatif Andhra
 Varta^ Andhra Praja^ Sastrekhay Janavani and some other journals
arose but were short-lived. During the last 25 years the cinema
industry has made rapid progress and has given rise also to some
journals like Rapeaam which are mainly devoted to reviews of
Film pictures.
    Z<m%n Raitu started by Venkata Rama Naidu and Sadhana
edited by Pappuri Ramacharlu are popular weeklies. The
 Fortnightly Ckitragupta and the monthly Vinodini have had a
 continuous life for more than 20 years.
    Among the Journals mainly devoted to trends in modem
literature, Sahiti started by Sabhapati Tallavajjahala Siva Sankara
 Sastri in 1919 and Pratihha of Telikicherla Venkataratnam in
 1934 were a source of inspiration to the young writers of the age.
 Muddukrishna’s JvaUiy Tapi Dharma Rao’s Kagada^ Andhra Bhumi
 and Prabuddhandhra were, though short-lived, very popular in their
days.
    With the growth of Nationalism and the dawn of political
 freedom and independence of the country. Journalism has had a
fresh impetus. Navasedetiy a weekly that came into existence in
 1936 was stopped by the Britidi government in 1939. Praja
 Sakti started in 1941 as a weekly of the Communists, became a
 Daily under the editorship of Maddukuri Chandrasekhara Rao.
 It advocated the cause of the oppressed and down-trodden classes
of people. It had, however, its rise and fSl. It was banned by
J^FEMDIX XI—JOURNALISM                                           m
 the Grovemment in 1948 but was revived in 1951 — not however,
 as a Daily .but as a Weekly. Later on, it became a Bi-weekly,
 and in 185^ it became a Daily, known as ViseUandhra. It has had
 a continuous life with increasing popularity.
    There were many more journals — Weekly, Fortnightly, and
 Monthly like iTiron, Mazdur, Worker^ Nagara^ Naoayugaf Vidyarthij
 Upadhycya^ Andhra Vanita and Janata. They were intended to
 promote the interests of different professions. There were also
 Janmahhumi at Vijayavada, Vtjayaprabkat and sucli other journals
 to support different political creeds and ideologies. But all these
Journals were only short-lived.
    Andhra Mahila Patrika which was started by Durga Bai Deshmukh
  15 years ago has had a continuous and prosperous life and is
 widely read by the educated Telugu women. Natyakala a journal
 devoted to the dramatic art, has had several vicissitudes. It is
 now being edited by Srinivasa Chakravarti with ability and
enthusiasm.
    Journalism in Telangana is comparatively ©f a later origin.
 The first was a Weekly known as Hita Bodhini from Mahboobnagar
 under the editorship of Srinivasa Sarma in 1913; but it was closed
 early in 1914. Next in 1920 there appeared two weeklies, one
 by the name of Telugu Patrika from the district of Warangal and
 another Nilagiri from Nalgonda, These journals flourished for
 five years but were stopped when in 1925 Suravaram Pratapa
 Reddi started another weekly known as Golkonda. Both supported
 the Andhra Political Movement and agitation for a separate
province.
    When the need for a literary journal was felt, Sujata appeared
in 1927, as a Monthly under the editorship of P. N. Sarma and it
used to publish several articles on literary subjects, but it did not
live long. Later on appeared two monthlies, Divyavanij Andhra
Kesarif and Andhrabhyudayam. It took a long time for a Telugu
daily to appear in Hyderabad. In response to a serious agitation,
the Nizam Government sanctioned the starting of two Telugu
dailies Telangana, and Meezan, the former under the editorship
of Bukkapatnam Ramanujachari and the latter .under the editor-
-ship of Adivi Bapirazu, but they could not live long. It is however
gratifying to note that Golkonda Patrika which had been a bi-weekly
became, through the endeavours of Narothama Reddi, a Telugu
daily and has been in existence since then. The second Telugu
282                                 HISTOAY OF TEU90U UTEftATOIIE

daily in Telaitgana b An^a JaMtOf which was#9tarted in 1965
under the editorship of K. S, Subrahmanyam. A literary Tehign
journal, known as Sobha appeared under the editorship of Devula»
 palli Ramanuja Rao in 1947, but it was short-lived.
   After the Police Action in 1948 there was> a flood of Telugu
Journals — Sujatay Pragatit Bhagyant^ar, Padmat^if Jam SakH,
Pr(^asaktij Praja Tttg(m, Medhauiy Jaya Bharaty KakatiyOy CkUra
 VicbitrOy Sudarsariy etc. But as the montientary emotion and
enthusiasm subsided, some of these journals dbappeared. Of the
existing journals, Golkondoy Andhra Janahty Telugudesam, Neta,
Sravantiy Navasakti and Telugu Swatantra are the most important. .
   Bddy the most popular monthly for children, started at
Madras fifteen years ago by Nyapati Raghava Rao and his wife
Kamesvaramma as joint editors, came to be issued from Hyderabad.
   It is interesting to note that a mcmthly known as Andhra
Crantkalaya Sarvasvamu founded and edited by Ayyanki Venkata*
ramanayya has had a continuous life for about 35 years and is
now edited by Paturi Nagabhushana Rao. It is mainly devoted
to the activitites of the various libraries in die villages and towns
of Andhra Pradesh.
   There are now 7 dailies, 3 bi-weeklies, 53 weddfes, 26 fort-
nightlies and 105 monthlies, besides many bi-lingual journals.

Literary Products of Journalism
   Narla Venkatesvara Rao is a typical literary product of Telugu
journalism. His innate talent is for belles-letters. He values
felicity of expression and vivacity of thought. With festidious
taste and meticulous precision he used to write his editorials, and
with the same fine qualities, he commenced to compose his short
plays and verses in Telugu. He has, thorefore^ ctxEue to prominence
not only as a Telugu journalist but also as a litterateur. His
critical study of books and of human nature—at home and abroad,
and his versatility are revealed in his essays, Matamanir, PichhapaHy
and Samskritiy in his one-act and short plays {Kottageedda)} and
in his poems, Vastavammu Pfariaaari Mata and jagermakdeam. His
essays are flavoured with gentle humour, and they ore also
sometimes tinged with poignant sarcasm. His playlets are
best of his writings. They relate to the present day cctnflict
between the old and the young, between sta^paation and
APPENDIX n-JOURNALlSM                                 283
progress. His jVor/am Mata is composed after the model set
by Vemana.
  There are others Wf Nilamraju Venkata Seshayya, Vidvaa
Visvam, T. Ramachandra, K. Kutumba Rao and Gora Sastri
who may also be regarded as products of journalism.
                            APPENDIX III

                          Janapada Geyas

      By Jmapadagtyas is meant the songs composed and sung by the
   unsophisticated inhabitants of the rural areas. It is not possible
   to trace their origin because till recently they had never been
   committed to writing; nor had they been ever recognised as pait
   of Sahttya (literature). The pandits had no regard for them,
   because they were composed not in the kavya dialect but in the
   spoken tongue of the lustic people. When for the first time, an
   attempt was made by the young scholars like Ncdunuri Ganga-
   dharam, Ellora, Hari Adiseshu, Krishna Sn and B. Ramaraju,
   it was possible to collect only those that were current in the country.
   The number of songs coPectcd by these and other lovers of folkloie
  does not go be)ond a thousand in all. Several thousands of
  songs must have been lost. For a satisfactory collection there
  should be an organisation of a Folk-lore Society as in America
  and other advanced countries of the West; and scholars of every
 district and Taluk should be encouraged to collect all the available
  material — stories, traditions as well as songs under “ Folk-lore.”
      Krishna Sn had toured all over the Telugu country and collected
   187 folk songs current in the three regions of Andhra Pradesh —
  Telangana, Rayalasima and the coastal districts. He classified
  the songs under several categories viz; (1) Agricultural and
 professional (2) Exploits of local heroes, (3) Domestic and other
 occupations, (4) Games and Sports, (5) Delights and distresses
 in daily life, (6) Prankish and humourous songs, (7) Boat-men
 songs (8) Amorous or erotic songs and (9) Mystic and spiritual
-son^gs.
     Songs of section 5—^Delights and Distresses in daily life—are like
 mirrors in which the social life of the Telugus is reflected. Songs
 of section 8—^Amorous songs—contain references to very interesting
 and amusing incidents with gentle humour and jokes. The last
^section Mystic and Spiritual songs, contains material for serious
 thinking. One of these songs refers to all the ten incarnations of
Vishnu in simple Telugu, current among the country folk.
.Another song contains an appeal to the Supreme soul for the
                                     284
 APPENDIX m—JANAPADA OEYAS                                       285
  emancipation of the individual soul from the human body which
  is subject to a vain-glorious life. There is yet another song which
  expresses in a poetic vein the nine days wonder of the vanity of
  human wishes, and how the body perishes and “ dust goes with
  dust
     Hari Adiseshu wrote his Janapadagtya Vangmaya Parichayamu
 and received the State Award in 1953. It was published in 1954.
 In the introductory chapter he discussed the features of Janapada-
 vangmayam (folk-lore) and classified the songs he had collected
 under topical heads viz., Amorous or erotic songs; songs of heroes
 — ballads of historical heroes and of quasi-historical heroes of
 local tradition which depict their courageous exploits; songs of
 tragic developments which are full of wonder and pathos; songs
 1 elating to the religious creeds and rituals of the Hindus; philo¬
 sophical songs; songs generally sung by women; and songs to
 amuse children such as lullabies and cradle songs.
     A very voluminous work with a far larger collection of more
than 1000 folk-songs is Telugii Janapadageya Sahityamu published
bv B. Ramaraju in 1958. It was his thesis for the degree of
Ph.D. conferred on him by the Osmania University, Hyderabad.
The author had travelled all over the Telugu country — the
Cbastal districts and Rayalasima as well as his own Telangana,
 and spared no pains in collecting the songs curicnt in those parts.
He consulted all the published literature in the field, including
the collections, made by Ellora, Krishna Sri, Adi Seshu, Nedimuri
Gangadharam, the society of Telangana writers—Selayeru (the
1 ivulets)—and lengthy articles on the subject by scholars like Ghinta
Dikshitulu, Tekumalla Kamesvara Rao, Sripada Gopalakrishna*
murti, and Illindala Sarasvati Devi.
    Ramaraju wrote a lengthy introduction to his book in which
he discussed the features of folk-lore and examined the songs in
his collection under the following heads:—

     1.   Songs relating to the Epic and Puranic lore — the
            Rameyana, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata, etc.
    2.    Songs relating to the historical and quasi-historical,
            legendary and traditional stories including the well
            known ballads.
    3.    Songs relating to the several religious creeds — Saivism,,
            Vaishnavism, etc.
1i86                                 HISTORY OF TELUOU LITERATURE

       4.  Devotional, philosophical, spiritual and ritual songs.
       5.   Songs generally sung by women     probal^y also composed
              by them — relating to their maiden, marital and
              advanced stages of life.
        6. Songs relating to the several professional pursuits of men
              and also women — agricultural, industrial, etc.
        7. Songs composed by the elders to amuse their grown up
              and young children, such as lullabies and cradle songs
              and songs composed by children also.
        8. Amorous or erotic songs.
        9. Songs of stories of wonder and tragic and pathetic tales
              from real life.
       10. Short stories of wit and humour.

   In some ballads and a few other songs a reference is made to the
author, but in most cases such a mention could not be made. It
is not possible to fix the date of the song in such cases. But from
references to well known local heroes or local incidents, it is possible
to infer that such songs were composed subsequent to those
incidents. Internal evidence of language is not always helpful.
Reference to company, court, telegram, railway journey, governor,
etc., give us some clue to determine in broad lines the origin of
such songs. In the case of many songs we find no clue at all, but
from the popularity of the song and currency in the country, we
can roughly determine the antiquity or the genesis of a song. A
song, for example, which is current all over Andhra Pradesh must
have been sufficiently old to have such a vide diffusion. There
are some lullabies, songs relating to Krishna and devotional songs
which are sung all over the Telugu country almost in the same way.
   Nandiraju Chalapati Rao of Eluru collected some songs known
as Strtia patalu — songs relating to women composed either by
women or by men for them. The Andhra Sarasvata Panshad of
Hyderabad recently published Strila Patalu and Pallepatalu in two
short volumes.
   The disregard of the pandits has a benevolent as well as a baneful
effect on the survival of the Janapadageyas, For want of recognition
by the Pandits they were never recorded and preserved for posterity.
iMong with this baneful effect, there was the benevolient effect of
non-interference with the composition ojf the song* The folk
songs had, therefore, a natural and healthy growth and the language
appendix 1U—-janapada gxyas                                       287
 used was the natural spokoi tongue and the metre used was the
 Desi metre — not influenced by the Sanskrit Chkandas, The
 folk songs serve, therefore as ample ground for the research scholars
 of Ethnology and Folklote as well as of language and literature.
    There are among the fl>lk>songs, smne ballads relating to the
 local heroes. Such ballads existed in one form or other in other
 languages also. The first known ballad in Telugu is that of
 Srinatha (15th century A.D.) and is known as Palnati Vim Charitra.
 It was composed in (Matyan) dvipada metre. Akkir^’u
 Umakantam, a great scholar of Sanskrit and Telugu, edited this
 ballad with a lengthy, scholarly and critical introduction. He
 was so highly enamoured of this poem that he would regard it
 as virtually the first piece of genuine Telugu literature. He says
 that all the previous literature even including Srinatha’s Hara
  Vilasamu had been only translations or adaptations.         On the
 contrary, the classicist scholar who does not recognise ballads as
 peurt of “ Dignified ” literature, would go to the length of saying
 that Srinatha would never have composed such cheap literature.
    The battle of Falnad took place in about 1182 A.D. It was a
 war between the children of two brothers and was, therefore,
 similar to the Mahabharata war. Pandit Umakantham would
 regard the Palnad heroes to be as great as the heroes of the Maha¬
 bharata war. The descriptions given in this ballad either about
 the situations or about the heroic deeds of Brahma Naidu or the
 more courageous Balachandra are, as Umakantam says, on a
 par with those of Arjuna and Abhimanyu. The strategy of
 Nayakuralu is not inferior to that of either Dharmaraja or
 Dhartarashtra. Though Umakantham might have exaggerated
 the greatness of the ballad, it is admitted on all hands that it is a
 good and typical baUad, and it inspired some other poets to
 compose similar ballads. An earlier story of Katamarazu (about
  1170) was the theme of a ballad of the same name and it was
 composed by Komanala Yellaya. It relates to the story of a local
 chief Katamarazu and the neighbouring Siddirazu. From the
 descriptiotts given in the ballad we learn that 90 thousand cavalry,
 88 thousand soldiers, 15 thousand camels took part in fighting.
 This seems to be an exaggeration. Moreover there were some
 anadbronisms in the ballad such as references to the use of guns,
'to Francis Day and the Rsyahs of Ghandragiri who gave him
 Madrstt ^ whldi were events of far later history. But in spite of
288                                HISTORY OF TELUQU LITERATURE-

such defects which might be interpolations, the bal^d was composed
in good style with inspiring descriptions of incidents and heroes.
Katamarazu became a divine hero and is worshipped even now.
People believe that by worshipping that divine hero they can have
rains in times of drought and barren women will be blessed with
 children.
    A subsequent and popular ballad is known as Bohbili pata (song) -
 This relates to the well-known battle fought in 1757 between the
 Raja of Bobbin, Ranga Rao, and the French General Bussy helped
 by the Raja of Vijayanagaram, Vijayaramaraju. The oiiginal
 version of the ballad was composed by Peddada Mallesam, son of
 Peddada Nagesam.
    This ballad too has exaggerations. While historical records
 mention that the army of Vijayaiamaraju consisted of 1100
 soldiers, the ballad raises the number to 94 thousand and similarly
 Bussy’s army of 750 is said to be 24 thousand in the ballad.
    In recent years, the story of Alluri Sitaramaraju has become
 the theme of a ballad composed by Sunkara Satyanarayana.
 It relates to the exploits of Alluri Sitaramaraju (1921) against
 the British Government with his abode in some unknown thickets
and caves among the hill. The ballad describes how Raju used
to march with his followers against the police stations in the plains
 and carry away the swords and guns and ail other ammunition
found in the stations. His sudden and unexpected sallies were
 as surprising as those of Sivaji. For a long time all attempts made
 by the police and the soldiers to catch him were futile. But at
last by some strategy he was spotted out and shot dead.
    All these ballads are simg in the country by troupes of minstrels.
In olden days, each troupe consisted of the chief singer with a
stringed instrument known as tamhura (guitar) and two women
standing on either side of him with a drum called gummeta or
Bttrra. Usually the two women were his wives. In course of
time there were slight changes in the constitution of the troupes.
   The modern Burrakatha has evolved out of the old ballads.
Sunkara Satyanarayana is regarded as the first composer of the
Burrakathas. Nazar Sheik is the best and the most popular composer
and singer. Uma Maheswar Rao, Krishnamurti and Radha
Rukmini are some others active in this field. Prayaga Narasimha
Sastri of the All India Radio Station at Vijayawada is a sweet
singer and he combines the Harikatha an? Bwrrak^ha types and
appendix III—^JANAPADA OEYAS                                   28^

recites his own compositions which relate to the national heroes of
India and particularly Andhra.
   Recently boys and girls at several places in Andhra Pradesh
have formed their own troupes to recite the Burrakathas popular
in the country.
   The Janapadag^as have inspired several poets of this age, the
most prominent among them being Gurazada Appa Rao, Basava-
 razu Appa Rao, Chinta Dikshitulu, Devulapalli Krishna Sastri^
 Visvanatha Satyanarayaxia,      Turaga    Venkataramaiah and
 Kavikondala Venkata Rao. Some poets like Adavi Bapir^u,
 Nanduri Venkata Subba Rao and Kavikondala Venkata Rao
 have composed several songs on the model of Janapadageyas.
   T. Ramanjaneyulu is a well known composer of Burrakathas in
Telangana which, like his songs, relate to the political problems
 of Telangana before the formation of Andhra Pradesh.

                 Poetesses as a Special Feature

     Utukuri Lakshmikantamma, a good Sanskrit and Telugu
   Scholar, published Andhra Kavayitrulu — an account of 131 women
  writers, from Ghaiiamma, wife of Khadga Tikkana and the sister-
  in-law of Tikkana Somaysji, ihc Mahahharata poet of 13th century,
  to the present day living poetesses. This book secured her the
  State Award in 1952. As I have already given a brief account
  of the most important poetesses of the previous centuries upto the
  time of Viresalingam, I shall here refer to the women writers
 of the modem age. Among the poetesses of the last years of
  19th century, Mamidanna Subhadramma deserves notice as the
 authoress of the Ramayana in the popular dvipada metre based on
 Adhyatma Ramayana songs of the previous age. Kotikalapudi
 Sitamma (1872-1934) came to projninence with her Sadhuraksha
 Satakam, and her Inography of Viresalingam Pantulu in verse. It
 is an admirable poem in simple style. Silam Subhadramma
 (1876-1947) was a poetess of high merit. Her Ramayana is the best
 among her poems and her novel Jagila was based on a French
story narrated to her by her yoimger brother Setti Lakshminara-
simham.
    Encouraged by Viresalingam’s activities to promote r-hi cation
among women, some ladies started journals mainly for thi' uplift
of the women. Balantrapu Seshamma and Mosalikanti Rama-
bayamma edited Hindu Sundari during the time of Viresalingam
and later wrote leading articles, advocating social reforms
and the uplift of women. Pulagurti Laksminarasamma (1878-
1953) edited for many years her monthly journal Savitri with the
object of opposing social reform which aimed at transgressing old
traditions of caste and creed. Vinjamuri Venkataratnamma
(1889-1950) who came to prominence with her Sarada Lekhalu
edited her journal, Anasuya from 1914 to 1920. This was
revived for about two years by her daughters Anasuya and Sita
(1949-1950).
    Tallapragada Visvasundaramma, Basavafazu Rajalakshmamma
and Chavali Bangaramma are the three top ranking Bhtwaka^
                                 290
  APPENDIX IV—POETESSES                                          29r
   vajfitris of the present age. Among the poetesses of the classicEf
   type stands foremost, Kavitaviscarada Kanchanapalli Kanakamzna.
   She was a prolific writer of poems, dramas and stories. Of
   her poems Jtvayatra and of her dramas, Hamsmijayam may be
   regarded as the best, and both are of philosophical interest.
   Gudipudi Indumati Devi is another prolific writer of many
  major and minor poems and stories. Her Lakshmema Parimyam,
  Ambarisha Vijqyam and Janma Bhum ‘are the best of her poems.
     Prominent among those that received Dr. Kesari’s Suoama
  Kankanam for their scholarship or their^ contributions to Telugu
  literature are Kanuparti Varalakshmamma known very widely
  for her Sarada Lekhalu and Chebrolu Sarasvati Devi whose
  Ramayana is much appreciated; Gidugu Lakshmikantamma
  (1903) who along with her husband’s sister, Jonnalagadda
  Saradamma (1912-1944), published many short poems and songs
 of which their dialogues in verse on ethical and social problems
  are most interesting; Sthanapati Rukminamma authoress of
 several lyrical and romantic poems; Kavitilaka Pulavarti Kamala
 Devi, authoress of several poems, dramas and novels, and
 Utukuri Lakshmikantamma, authoress of Andhra Kavayitrulu*
     Ponaka Kanakanuna (1892) and Dronamraju Lakshmibayamma
 (1909) are the joint authoresses of a Telugu version of Bhagaaat
 Gita and of Aradhanay a tribute to Ramana Maharshi, Kotturi
 Visalakshamma (1901) whose lengthy poem, Bharata Kathamritam
 the best of her productions, is a talented poetess of the old type.
 Ganti Venkata Subbamma (1890) a scholar of several languages
 has composed many short poems of which Girija Kalyanam is the
 best. Ravuri Venkatasubbamma (1890) a scholar of Saskrit and
 Telugu is the authoress of a poem, Karpuramanjari an adaptation
of the Prakrit work by Rajasekhara.
    Simakurti Satyavati Devi (1895) belongs to a cultural family
of modernists in social life. She developed her poetic talent in
her young age and composed many short poems. Her Satakam
addressing her mother Annapurna has verses which criticise the
superiority complex of man and his desire to keep his wife behind
the purdah as his bondwoman.
    Desiraju Bharati Devi (1905) composed several poems. Her
book on the influence of the Telugu Bharata poets on the later
Telugu poets won her the State Award in 1955.
    Puttaparti Kanakamma a partner in life and in literary field
292                              HISTORY OF TELUOU UTBRATURE

of the well-known author, Narayanacharyulu, has independently
composed many poems relating to the repentance of Yasodhara,
aggrieved Sita, and ruins of Vijayanagara (Hampi), in every
one of which we find her fecundity of imagination, and felicity of
expression.
   Burra Kamala Devi (1908) has acquired scholarship in Telugu,
Sanskrit and English and composed many short poems relating
to the nationalist movement and also lyrico-romantic poems with
several themes and in varying metres. Pathos is generally the
main sentiment in many, of her poems. She is now engaged in
translating into Telugu verse, some hymns of the Rigveda*
   Nayani Krishna Kumari is a talented poetess and prose writer.
Her Andhrula Katha is her master-piece.
    Chanduri Rama Devi (1912) is a regular contributor of short
stories and poems to the leading Telugu journals. Her poem
Dampatyam exhibits her high conception of happiness in married
life.
   Dr. Ammayamma’s Janmantaratm is an interesting poem to
illustrate transmigration of souls.
   Koitapalli Lalita (1930) brought up in a poetic atmosphere at
home with her father, Rayaporulu Subba Rao, and enthused by
her husband, K. Virabhadra Rao, created her own standards of
language and metrical conventions, and composes lyrical poems
caring more for melody and thought than for conventional form.
   A reference to some women who published short stories etc
was made in the previous sections. There are many more writers
among the young women of this generation like Malati Ghendur,
Bhanumati Ramakrishna, Usha, K. Ramalakshmi who are con¬
tributing interesting articles of literary merit to the leading
Telugu journals.
